However, challenges such as security, privacy, trust, scalability, verifiability, and centralization prevent faster adaptations of IoT-driven smart cities. Thus, in this paper, a Trustworthy Privacy-Preserving Secured Framework (TP2SF) for smart cities is presented. This framework includes three modules namely: a trustworthiness module, a two-level privacy module, and an intrusion detection module. In trustworthiness module, address-based blockchain reputation system is designed. In the two-level privacy module, a blockchain based enhanced Proof of Work (ePoW) technique is simultaneously applied with Principal Component analysis (PCA) to transform data into a new reduced shape for preventing inference and poisoning attacks. In the intrusion detection module, an optimized gradient tree boosting system (XGBoost) is deployed. Finally, due to inherited strengths and weaknesses of Fog–Cloud architecture, we present a blockchain-IPFS integrated Fog–Cloud infrastructure namely, CloudBlock and FogBlock to deploy proposed TP2SF framework in smart city. The TP2SF framework is evaluated using two realistic IoT-based datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. The findings indicate the superiority of TP2SF framework over other state-of-the-art techniques in both nonblockchain and blockchain systems.$Keywords: Machine learning; Blockchain; Smart city; Anomaly detection; Privacy-preservation; Trust management; Internet of Things$

However, efficient, and accurate human-centric video summarization in real-time videos is still a challenging issue due to several inconsistencies such as noise, illumination effects, scale, or rotational variance, etc. Though, several prominent research studies are available related to human activities detection but a robust human-centric video summarization approach is a major issue. In this research, we expound an efficient video summary generation model (ReHuSum) that creates a short summary with human. Our approach employs the conception of domain adaptation for efficient summarization via transferring the knowledge of a potent pre-trained benchmark Inception-v3 model. Additionally, a frame differencing redundancy removal technique is adopted that aids in generating a precise and accurate video summary with human. Our model generates efficient short summaries from real-time videos with an overall human detection accuracy of 99.97%. Besides, we present two novel qualitative metrics namely; summarization rate (Summrate) and summarization loss (Summloss) for assessing the efficacy of overall summarization. The approach generates a real-time human-based summary of 46s with a (Summrate) of 98.7% and (Summloss) of 0.013 for an outdoor CCTV with a duration of 25.2 min. Similarly, an indoor CCTV of 40.10 min duration is summarized to 44s at a (Summrate) of 96.5% and (Summloss) of 0.035. The model can be utilized in real-time security applications (i.e., border or home surveillance, critical infrastructure, smart cities, etc.) to generate accurate video summaries with human.$Keywords: Human-centric video summarization; Human detection; Video surveillance; Domain adaptation; Inception-v3$

Smart user interfaces, smart homes, or smart buildings are becoming common examples in the new era of smart cities. Software architectures usually related to these domains need to be adapted and reconfigured at run-time, for example, to provide new services, react to user interaction, or due to changes decided from the business logic of the application. Component-based techniques are a suitable way to carry out this kind of adaptation, as dynamic reconfiguration operations can be applied to the architecture. In this paper, we address run-time generation of component-based applications, taking the abstract definitions of their architecture as a reference, in addition to a set of available components. The process calculates the best configuration of components from the abstract definition by applying a trading approach based on an adapted A* algorithm. This algorithm uses heuristics based on syntactic and semantic information obtained from the component definitions. A case study related to mashup user interfaces formed by coarse-grained components is also explained. In short, the results show the usefulness of heuristics and suitable execution times for building the best configurations.$Keywords: Dynamic software architectures; Heuristics; Trading; A* search; Model-based engineering$

Adaptive and individualized education is now a must to reduce the drawbacks of distance learning while ensuring high levels of accomplishment. Technology such as machine learning, artificial intelligence (XAI), and data mining are all helping to transform education in a smart city by allowing for personalized learning and the ability to tailor content based on individual preferences. Based on the combination of XAI and IoB technologies, this study proposes a new paradigm for smart educational systems. Using data on students' actions, researchers try to establish whether or not contemporary educational systems meet students' needs. Education systems have evolved, but not to the point where they can be personalized to meet the cognitive demands of students and assist them when face-to-face instruction isn't available. Using evaluation methods, the study found that there has been a shift in students' academic progress when monitoring using IoT/IoB to enable a relative response in support of their progression. The system response to learners was 37%, once we involve the IoB in the processes and let students and the system be aware of the collected and used data about students' behaviours, the student's response improved to 76 % . This indicates the major influence of IoB on learner assistance and system adaptations to their real demands for higher achievement.$Keywords: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI); the Internet of behaviour (IoB); Smart education; future AI-based education; Smart cities education; adaptive learning$

To start addressing this problem, in this paper we devise a formally correct and self-adaptive implementation of distributed monitors for spatial properties. We start from the Spatial Logic of Closure Spaces, and provide a compositional translation that takes a formula and yields a distributed program that provides runtime verification of its validity. Such programs are expressed in terms of the field calculus, a recently emerged computational model that focusses on global-level outcomes instead of single-device behaviour, and expresses distributed computations by pure functions and the functional composition mechanism. By reusing previous results and tools of the field calculus, we prove correctness of the translation, self-stabilisation of the derived monitors, and empirically evaluate adaptivity of such monitors in a realistic smart city scenario of safe crowd monitoring and control.$Keywords: Spatial logics; Runtime verification; Self-adaptive systems; Field calculus$
