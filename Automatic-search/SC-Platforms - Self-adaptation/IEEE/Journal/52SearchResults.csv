The security of WSNs is one of the key issues of smart cities. In resource-restrained WSNs, dynamic ongoing or unknown attacks usually steer clear of isolated defense components. Therefore, to resolve this problem, we propose a hierarchical framework based on chance discovery and usage control (UCON) technologies to improve the security of WSNs while still taking the low-complexity and high security requirements of WSNs into account. The features of continuous decision and dynamic attributes in UCON can address ongoing attacks using advanced persistent threat detection. In addition, we use a dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism to detect unknown attacks. To design and implement a system using the mechanism described above, a unified framework is proposed in which low-level attack detection with simple rules is performed in sensors, and high-level attack detection with complex rules is performed in sinks and at the base station. Moreover, software-defined networking and network function virtualization technologies are used to perform attack mitigation when either low-level or high-level attacks are detected. An experiment was performed to acquire an attack data set for evaluation. Then, a simulation was created to evaluate the resource consumption and attack detection rate. The results demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2517321","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61401273,61431008); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI through the JSPS A3 Foresight Program.(grant numbers:26730056,15K15976); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383218","Smart city;attack detection;chance discovery;wireless sensor networks (WSNs);software-defined networking;Smart city;wireless sensor networks (WSNs);chance discovery;attack detection;software-defined networking","Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Base stations;Access control;Smart cities;Hierarchical systems","computer network security;smart cities;software defined networking;virtualisation;wireless sensor networks","resource consumption;high-level attacks;network function virtualization;software defined networking;low-level attack detection;unknown attack detection;dynamic adaptive chance discovery mechanism;advanced persistent threat detection;UCON technology;usage control technology;chance discovery technology;isolated defense component;smart services;WSN hierarchical security framework;smart cities;resource-restrained wireless sensor network;sophisticated attacks","","106","","35","OAPA","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As the digitalization trend goes on with an increasing pace and with the involvement of a diverse set of actors, proper management of this digital layer as well as the services deployed over it becomes ever more crucial. This paper presents our methodology of transforming the complex smart city concept and its digital layer into a structured model for creating a dynamic and adaptive service ecosystem in the digital cities of the future. An overview of the smart city concept and the three-tier architecture that emerges through the digitalization of cities is presented first, together with the main challenges in attaining coherent smart city service environments that can avoid fragmentation, ensure scalability, and allow reuse. The three major enablers that are identified in this direction are 1) a semantic functional description of city objects, representing physical devices or abstract services; 2) a distributed service directory that embodies available city services for service lookup and discovery; and 3) planning tools for selecting and chaining basic services to compose new complex services. For each of these, a high-level overview of the available tools and results from the research literature are provided as well as the relevant standards. This overview is complemented with our own approach and design choices in project ISCO (Internet of smart city objects). Through the implementation of two distinct use cases, this paper illustrates how ISCO components can jointly enrich service creation and consumption of various stakeholders in smart cities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2893340","Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung(grant numbers:16KIS0580); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8616795","Smart cities;smart city objects;service discovery;service composition;semantic service description;adaptive planning","Smart cities;Standards;Tools;Interoperability;Europe","Internet;smart cities;town and country planning;Web services","digital layer;dynamic service ecosystem;adaptive service ecosystem;digital cities;coherent smart city service environments;abstract services;distributed service directory;service lookup;complex services;smart city objects;service creation;city resources;digitalization trend;complex smart city concept;city services","","33","","69","OAPA","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To achieve optimal signal timing, many studies have attempted to adjust green splits of a cycle time according to the distance between road intersections. However, existing green wave traffic control systems usually require a sophisticated calculation that depend upon the stability of vehicle speed and traffic flow, which can lead to weak robustness. Therefore, this article proposes two novel approaches to control arterial traffic coordination with the help of artificial intelligence: DDPG-BAND and ES-BAND. DDPG-BAND has two stages: a coarse-tuning stage reduces the blocking coefficient, and a fine-tuning stage optimizes the traffic evaluation index. ES-BAND introduces the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy (CMA-ES), a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning, into signal timing. Different traffic variables are adopted as parameters to search for the optimal value by the CMA-ES. To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approaches, we import real traffic flow data from Zhongshan Road, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, into a traffic environment simulator for training and then conduct a series of experiments. The results show that ES-BAND outperforms the traditional methods in terms of better convergence, lower journey time, fewer stops, and more throughput.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3037129","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB210310,2019YFB2103104); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2019M663070); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:4197134); Open Fund of the Key Laboratory of Urban Land Resources Monitoring and Simulation, Ministry of Land and Resources(grant numbers:KF-2018-03-036); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9253530","Green wave traffic;artificial intelligence;optimization;signal control;smart city","Training;Roads;Green products;Stability criteria;Traffic control;Throughput;Timing","covariance matrices;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;road traffic control;traffic engineering computing","smart city construction process;optimal signal timing;green splits;cycle time;road intersections;green wave traffic control systems;vehicle speed;weak robustness;DDPG-BAND;ES-BAND;coarse-tuning stage;fine-tuning stage;traffic evaluation index;Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy;CMA-ES;traffic variables;traffic flow data;traffic environment;lower journey time;green wave system;urban arterial traffic coordination control","","8","","59","CCBYNCND","10 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this model, one transmitter sends out a single signal and it is then reflected back from the targets and received by the distributed sensor array system. A joint reference signal-based beamformer (JRSB) is proposed for the static/slowly moving targets and UAV platforms where the Doppler effects can be ignored, leading to improved performance by exploiting the information collected by all the sub-arrays simultaneously. Then, the developed beamformer is extended to the dynamic case considering the Doppler effects, referred to as the frequency extended JRSB (FE-JRSB), achieving the potential maximum output signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) by exploiting the information across the potential frequencies of interest jointly. The output signal of the beamformer with increased SINR can be used to assist the extended target detection in the following processing. Simulation results show that both are able to extract the signals of interest while suppressing interfering signals, and a lower mean square error and a higher output SINR are achieved compared with a regular reference signal-based beamformer using a single sub-array. One unique feature of the provided solutions is that, although the signals involved are narrowband, the employed beamforming structure has to be wideband for it to be effective.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2875560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489853","Adaptive beamforming;distributed sensor network;unmanned aerial vehicle;static/moving targets;Doppler frequency","Sensor arrays;Array signal processing;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Interference;Object detection;Doppler effect;Signal to noise ratio","array signal processing;autonomous aerial vehicles;distributed sensors;Doppler effect;interference suppression;mean square error methods;object detection;remotely operated vehicles;sensor arrays","adaptive beamforming;surveillance;distributed unmanned aerial vehicle platforms;distributed sensor array network;arbitrary locations;rotation angles;UAV-based sub-array;predefined Cartesian coordinate system;single signal;distributed sensor array system;joint reference signal-based beamformer;UAV platforms;Doppler effects;improved performance;developed beamformer;employed beamforming structure;single sub-array;regular reference signal-based beamformer;higher output SINR;interfering signals;extended target detection;increased SINR;interference plus noise ratio;potential maximum output signal;FE-JRSB","","6","","27","CCBY","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"QoE Assessment of Encrypted YouTube Adaptive Streaming for Energy Saving in Smart Cities","W. Pan; G.

With the limited bandwidth of mobile networks, understanding the user perception of the quality (i.e., Quality of Experience or QoE) of video streaming services is thus paramount for content providers and content-delivery network providers to flexibly configure network bandwidth, video servers, routing devices, and other network resources to save energy in smart cities. Although various video QoE assessment approaches have been proposed using different key performance indicators (KPIs), they all essentially relate to a common parameter: bitrate. However, because YouTube has adopted hyper text transfer protocol over secure socket layer (HTTPS) as its adaptive video streaming method to better protect user privacy and network security, bitrate can no longer be obtained from encrypted video traffic via typical deep packet inspection. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a machine-learning-based bitrate estimation (MBE) approach to parse bitrate information from IP packet level measurements. First, we filter HTTPS YouTube traffic based on the previously established video server IP according to the data packet googlevideo field. Then, we identify the transmission mode according to the traffic characteristics of several previous packets. Next, we identify the bitrates and resolutions of HTTP Live Streaming and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP modes according to the characteristics of video chunks. Finally, for evaluating the effectiveness of MBE, we have chosen the video Mean Opinion Score (vMOS) proposed by a leading telecom vendor as the QoE assessment framework, and have conducted comprehensive experiments to study the impact of bitrate estimation accuracy on its KPIs for the HTTPS YouTube video streaming service. Experimental results show that MBE is a feasible and highly effective QoE evaluation approach to flexibly configure network resources in smart cities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2811416","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China(grant numbers:2015AA015603); Jiangsu Future Networks Innovation Institute: Prospective Research Project on Future Networks(grant numbers:BY2013095-5-03); Six talent peaks of high level Talents Project of Jiangsu province(grant numbers:2011-DZ024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8310894","Hyper text transfer protocol over secure socket layer (HTTPS) YouTube;QoE assessment;adaptive streaming;machine learning;smart city","Streaming media;Quality of experience;YouTube;Bit rate;Cryptography;Adaptive systems;Smart cities","cryptography;hypermedia;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of experience;smart cities;social networking (online);telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video servers;video streaming","content-delivery network providers;video servers;smart cities;video QoE assessment approaches;secure socket layer;user privacy;network security;MBE;IP packet level measurements;data packet googlevideo field;HTTPS YouTube video streaming service;vMOS;video mean opinion score;machine-learning-based bitrate estimation approach;HTTPS YouTube traffic characteristics;encrypted YouTube adaptive video streaming service;QoE evaluation approach;HTTP live streaming;video server IP;video traffic encryption;mobile network applications;dynamic adaptive streaming;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;KPI","","19","","52","OAPA","9 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Second, by leveraging some use cases as illustrative examples, we point out that the integration of the FC and IoE paradigms may give rise to opportunities for new applications in the realms of the IoE, Smart City, Industry 4.0, and Big Data Streaming, while introducing new open issues. Third, we propose a novel technological paradigm, the Fog of Everything (FoE) paradigm, that integrates FC and IoE and then we detail the main building blocks and services of the corresponding technological platform and protocol stack. Fourth, as a proof-of-concept, we present the simulated energy-delay performance of a small-scale FoE prototype, namely, the V-FoE prototype.

The resulting big data creates opportunities to develop diverse sets of context-aware services and systems, ensuring smart city services are optimized to the dynamic city environment. Critical resources in these smart cities will be more rapidly deployed to regions in need, and those regions predicted to have an imminent or prospective need. For example, crime data analytics may be used to optimize the distribution of police, medical, and emergency services. However, as smart city services become dependent on data, they also become susceptible to disruptions in data streams, such as data loss due to signal quality reduction or due to power loss during data collection. This paper presents a dynamic network model for improving service resilience to data loss. The network model identifies statistically significant shared temporal trends across multivariate spatiotemporal data streams and utilizes these trends to improve data prediction performance in the case of data loss. Dynamics also allow the system to respond to changes in the data streams such as the loss or addition of new information flows. The network model is demonstrated by city-based crime rates reported in Montgomery County, MD, USA. A resilient network is developed utilizing shared temporal trends between cities to provide improved crime rate prediction and robustness to data loss, compared with the use of single city-based auto-regression. A maximum improvement in performance of 7.8 % for Silver Spring is found and an average improvement of 5.6 % among cities with high crime rates. The model also correctly identifies all the optimal network connections, according to prediction error minimization. City-to-city distance is designated as a predictor of shared temporal trends in crime and weather is shown to be a strong predictor of crime in Montgomery County.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2757841","Information Technology Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8066282","Adaptive algorithms;geospatial analysis;predictive models;statistical learning","Smart cities;Resilience;Market research;Data models;Sensors;Predictive models","Big Data;data analysis;data handling;data mining;emergency services;Internet;police data processing;smart cities;town and country planning;ubiquitous computing","smart devices;big data;smart city data-loss resilience;crime rate prediction;city-to-city distance;optimal network connections;single city;resilient network;city-based crime rates;data prediction performance;multivariate spatiotemporal data streams;shared temporal trends;service resilience;data collection;data loss;emergency services;crime data analytics;smart cities;dynamic city environment;smart city services;context-aware services;sensors;city-to-city network;dynamic network model","","18","","21","OAPA","12 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The deployment and operational needs of energy-constrained network infrastructures in smart water and gas metering systems require the use of routing mechanisms that consider energy consumption, minimize energy use, and prolong network lifetime. An efficient routing metric is needed for energy-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose an energy- and congestion-aware routing metric for smart meter networks to be deployed in smart cities. The proposed metric is an adaptive parent node selection mechanism that considers the residual energy and queue utilization of neighboring nodes. Minimizing power consumption will enhance network lifetime. The proposed scheme was evaluated with the Cooja Simulator 3.0 using random and grid topology.

Besides the prior information, the persymmetric structure in radar systems with symmetric spaced linear array and constant pulse repetition interval can also be exploited to improve the STAP performance. In this paper, we present a new computationally adaptive knowledge-aided STAP method that requires fewer samples by utilizing the persymmetric structure of the covariance matrix. In addition, based on the covariance matrix estimation technology of the newly proposed knowledge-aided STAP method, two knowledge-aided persymmetric adaptive detectors in the nonhomogeneous environment are proposed as well. First, a two-step design procedure-based detector is proposed for the partially homogeneous model, which is called knowledge-aided persymmetric adaptive coherence estimator.

Small cells are composed with fixed ground radio units (RUs) in the conventional networks, and thus the utilization rate of them is drastically deteriorated due to the spatio-temporal patterns of mobile traffic demand. To address this problem, adaptive network architectures have been investigated to reconfigure networks on demand using small cells mounted on moving objects such as vehicles and drones. However, it has been difficult to establish stable communication link to ground nodes in high-speed environments with these schemes. Therefore, this paper proposes a concept of small cells composed with crowdsourced RUs mounted on parked vehicles. They are activated based on the traffic demand in surrounding area by road side units (RSUs) assuming a smart city. The proposed idea is based on the correlation between the distribution of people and the occupancy rate of parking lots.

The effectiveness of such techniques typically increases as the number of antennas grows. In contrast, computational and hardware costs very often limit the deployment of beamforming in large-scale arrays. To circumvent this problem, antenna selection strategies have been developed aiming to maintain much of the performance gain obtained by using a large array while keeping computational and hardware costs at acceptable levels. In this context, the present paper is dedicated to the development of two new adaptive algorithms for solving the problem of joint antenna selection and beamforming for uplink reception in mobile communication systems. Both algorithms are based on an alternating optimization strategy and are designed to operate with a limited number of radio-frequency chains. The main difference between the proposed algorithms is that the first is formulated by considering the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion, while the second is based on the minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) approach.

However, the performance of these techniques is limited when they are applied separately in each domain. Recently, adaptive signal processing algorithms based on high-dimensional signal subspaces have been studied extensively. We apply a four-dimensional unitary estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariant techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm for the simultaneous estimation of the DOAs, ranges, and Doppler velocities of multiple targets in an ultra-wideband radar imaging setting and show the effectiveness of the high-dimensional ESPRIT for the near-field imaging of distributed moving targets. The four-dimensional ESPRIT algorithm is demonstrated to be able to separate targets moving in close proximity, whereas the two- and three-dimensional ESPRIT algorithms fail to separate these targets accurately because of their limited resolutions. The application of the high-dimensional ESPRIT to near-field radar imaging covers a wide range of applications that require the measurement of multiple moving targets in close proximity. An example of such an application is radar-based human monitoring. Therefore, the superior resolution of the high-dimensional ESPRIT has the potential to improve the performance of various real-world security and healthcare systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2951537","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:15K18077,15KK0243,19H02155); Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology(grant numbers:JPMJPR1873); Center of Innovation Program(grant numbers:JPMJCE1307); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8890858","Adaptive signal processing;direction-of-arrival;multidimensional signal processing;radar imaging;ultra wideband radar","Radar imaging;Signal processing algorithms;Imaging;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Frequency-domain analysis;Signal resolution;Doppler effect","array signal processing;parameter estimation;radar imaging;ultra wideband radar","DOA estimation;high-dimensional signal subspaces;four-dimensional unitary estimation;signal parameters;rotational invariant techniques algorithm;near-field imaging;distributed moving targets;three-dimensional ESPRIT algorithms;multiple moving targets;radar-based human monitoring;ultrawideband array radar imaging setting;near-field radar targets;four-dimensional unitary ESPRIT algorithm;directions of arrival estimation;high-dimensional ESPRIT algorithm;time domain analysis;space domain analysis;frequency domain analysis;estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariant techniques;healthcare systems;adaptive signal processing techniques","","2","","36","CCBY","4 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a cognitive transmitting scheme to counter the deceptive jamming for airborne array radar. The proposed approach is composed of two steps. The first step is the deceptive jamming perception. A specially designed high pulse repetition frequency (PRF) waveform is transmitted, and then the deceptive jamming is identified according to the angle clustering feature of the false targets. In the second step, the phase-only transmit pattern with notches at the jammers' directions is designed. The encountered pattern synthesis problem is nonconvex due to the fixed excitations constraint. To solve this problem, a nested alternating direction method of multipliers (N-ADMM) is proposed. With the developed approach, the radiated power at the jammers' directions is attenuated significantly. Therefore, the probing signal possesses the characteristic of low probability of intercept (LPI).

Moreover, various projects have been initiated to bring this concept into reality. Smart city is basically an emergence of the existing and new Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) to make our living standard more safe and digitized. Wireless communications, such as sensors, actuators, intelligent transportation systems, and smart grids, have played a vital role in the dissemination of information under the given circumstances. Similarly, it is hard to declare any city as a smart city without taking benefits from wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, with new requirements and delay sensitive applications, the existing WSN requires significant alterations at several layers. In this paper, a new time division multiple access (TDMA)-based medium access control (MAC) protocol, called bitmap-assisted efficient and scalable TDMA-based MAC (BEST-MAC), is proposed for adaptive traffic in hierarchical WSNs that can be deployed in the smart cities. BEST-MAC is specifically designed to improve the quality control of such smart cities applications, where diverse traffic is required and loss or delay in data traffic is unacceptable. The main contributions of BEST-MAC include: 1) it uses small size time slots; 2) the number of those time slots is more than the number of member nodes; 3) knapsack algorithm is used to schedule time slots; and 4) short node address (1 B) is proposed to identify the member nodes. First two contributions of BEST-MAC handle adaptive traffic loads of all members in an efficient manner. The knapsack algorithm not only reduces the job completion time of a node but also minimizes the average packet delay with better link utilization. The short node address reduces the control overhead that improves the energy efficiency. The simulation results verify that the proposed BEST-MAC transmits more data with less delay and energy consumption compared with the existing MAC protocols.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2515096","President’s Leadership Fund Award at San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7373553","Smart Cities;Wireless Sensor Networks;MAC;TDMA;Contention Free;Smart cities;wireless sensor networks;MAC;TDMA;contention free","Media Access Protocol;Time division multiple access;Wireless sensor networks;Delays;Wireless communication;Smart cities;Wireless sensor networks","energy consumption;knapsack problems;quality control;smart cities;telecommunication power management;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic;time division multiple access;wireless sensor networks","energy consumption;control overhead reducetion;average packet delay minimization;member node identification;short node address;knapsack algorithm;small size time slot scheduling;data traffic;quality control improvement;adaptive traffic load;medium access control protocol;time division multiple access;delay sensitive applications;wireless sensor network;wireless communication;ICT;Information and Communication Technologies;smart cities;bitmap-assisted efficient and scalable TDMA-based WSN MAC protocol;BEST-MAC","","64","","18","OAPA","6 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The energy consumption increases when a user’s request (task) runs in the local mobile device instead of executing in the cloud. Whereas, latency become an issue when the task executes in the cloud environment instead of the mobile device. Therefore, a tradeoff between energy consumption and latency is required in building sustainable Internet of Things (IoT), and for that, we have introduced a middle layer named an edge computing layer to avoid latency in IoT. There are several real-time applications, such as smart city and smart health, where mobile users upload their tasks into the cloud or execute locally. We have intended to minimize the energy consumption of a mobile device as well as the energy consumption of the cloud system while meeting a task’s deadline, by offloading the task to the edge datacenter or cloud. This paper proposes an adaptive technique to optimize both parameters, i.e., energy consumption and latency by offloading the task and also by selecting the appropriate virtual machine for the execution of the task.

Conventional techniques towards this always consider the background as primary target and tend to adopt low-rank constraint as its estimator, which provides finite (equal to the value of rank) alternatives when constructing the background. However, in practical missions, although general sketch of background is stable, some details change constantly. Aimed at this, we propose to represent the general background by a linear combination of some atoms and record the detailed background by spatiotemporal clustered patches. Then, the moving foreground is considered as a mixture of active contours and continuous contents. Eventually, joint optimization is conducted under a unified framework, i.e., alternating direction multipliers method (ADMM), and produces our tensor model for hierarchical background and hierarchical foreground separation (THHS). The employed tensor space, which agrees with the instinct structure of video data, benefits all the spatiotemporal designs in both background modular and foreground part. Experimental results show that THHS is more adaptive to the dynamic background and produces more accurate foreground when compared against current state-of-the-art techniques.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2992494","Applied Basic Research Program of Qinghai(grant numbers:2019-ZJ-7017); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902106); High-Level Talent (Ph.D.) Program of Qinghai University for Nationalities(grant numbers:2020XJG13); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9086474","Dictionary learning;foreground-background separation;active contour model;quantization;hierarchical modeling","Tensors;Dictionaries;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Data models;Heuristic algorithms;Feature extraction;Active contours","feature extraction;image motion analysis;image representation;image segmentation;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;object tracking;tensors;video signal processing;video surveillance","ADMM;alternating direction multipliers method;THHS model;tensor model for hierarchical background and hierarchical foreground separation;tensor space;active contours;spatiotemporal clustered patches;low-rank constraint;moving foreground extraction;static background;surveillance video;active contour detection;dynamic dictionary update;tensor foreground-background separation algorithm","","10","","63","CCBY","5 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing tracking algorithms use appearance samples from previous frames to form a template set upon which target appearance models are built. However, these appearance models are data-dependent, so they may be corrupted by significant appearance variation. It is difficult to update the templates in challenging environments. In this paper, we propose a robust visual tracking algorithm with an adaptive appearance model using a point-to-set metric learning technique. To do this, we first model a target representation using a set of target templates and a regularized affine hull (RAH) spanned by the target templates. Then, we learn a point-to-set distance metric, which is incorporated into the optimization process to obtain an adaptive target representation. The RAH model covers unseen target appearances by affine combinations of the target templates. Based on the proposed target appearance model, we design an effective template update scheme by adjusting the weights of the target templates.

In the proposed algorithm, the AWC module detects and corrects possible color cast, the LLF module downplays non-hazy bright pixels (e.g., headlight and white objects) for more accurate airlight estimation, and the APP module uses the minimum/maximum channel and their difference for scene transmission estimation.

Therefore, the aim of this article is to provide a guideline to mayors and other city officials for interconnecting their smart cities with other smart cities for interoperability. For this purpose, we propose three interworking models that can be selected based on the status of the cities to be connected with each other. All these models enable the continuity of IoT services between cities using different technologies, that is, a standardized interface, interworking proxy, and semantics.

Maximizing the cross-correntropy between the system output and the desired response leads to the maximum correntropy criterion for system self-adaptation.

Therefore, our proposed surveillance-based vehicle type recognition system is implemented using only labels from Web data. This allows us to overcome the task of manually labeling the data from surveillance images during the training phase. We need to overcome the gap in the types of vehicles between two different imaging systems. For this, a regularization technique in transfer learning is introduced to the objective function of the traditional convolutional neural network. The proposed method was verified through experiments with the public data set comprehensive cars. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed recognition method outperforms existing deep learning methods when the training and test data are taken from different imaging systems.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2017.2765676","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:81671766,81301278,61571382,61571005,61172179,61103121); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2015A030313007); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:20720160075); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2017J01126); CCF-Tencent open grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8120162","Vehicle type recognition;surveillance images;convolutional neural network;transfer learning;unsupervised domain adaptation","Surveillance;Image recognition;Machine learning;Training;Imaging","image recognition;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object recognition","surveillance images;labeled Web-nature data;deep transfer learning;intelligent monitoring systems;labeled image data;vehicle manufacturers;surveillance-based vehicle type recognition system;Web data;public data set comprehensive cars;recognition method;imaging systems;deep learning method","","44","","30","IEEE","27 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the major IoT application areas that gets significant attention is smart city. Since it is unrealistic to expect full convergence toward a single IoT platform in the near future, it is mandatory to enable interworking between different platforms based on multiple standards, coexisting in the emerging smart cities. In this paper, we take the example of two global IoT standards, FIWARE and oneM2M, which are actively used in many smart city projects, and analyze them to show the feasibility of IoT platforms interworking. Based on the analysis, we design and implement a novel IoT interworking architecture providing a semantic driven integration framework suitable for smart city. The core idea behind our approach is to introduce interworking proxies that: 1) conduct a static mapping of sensor information between IoT platforms and 2) perform semantic interoperability using semantically annotated resources via a semantic interworking proxy that dynamically discovers new kinds of information and adapts itself to enable automatic translation of semantic data between given source and target IoT platforms while it is running. We present the system based on these proxies and evaluate it in Santander smart city. The results demonstrate that it is able to discover and manage IoT sensors connected to both oneM2M and FIWARE. It appears that the semantic approach provides the flexibility and dynamic adaptivity needed for fast growing and rapidly changing urban environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2905275","Horizon 2020 Framework Programme(grant numbers:723156); Korea Agency for Infrastructure Technology Advancement(grant numbers:18NSPS-B149386-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8667627","FIWARE;Internet-of-Things (IoT);interoperability;interworking;machine-to-machine (M2M);oneM2M;semantics;smart city;standards","Smart cities;Internet of Things;Semantics;Standards;Interoperability;Europe","Internet of Things;internetworking;open systems;smart cities;town and country planning","IoT sensors;semantic approach;adaptive semantic adapter;IoT application areas;emerging smart cities;global IoT standards;smart city projects;IoT platforms interworking;semantic driven integration framework;interworking proxies;semantic interoperability;semantically annotated resources;semantic interworking proxy;semantic data;Santander smart city;global IoT-enabled smart cities interworking;IoT interworking architecture","","65","","51","IEEE","15 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, it is difficult to accurately predict the vehicle state due to the highly dynamic road environment and various drivers' behaviors. To this end, in this article, we propose a two-level quantized adaptive Kalman filter (KF) algorithm based on the autoregressive moving average (MA) model to predict the vehicle state (including the moving direction, driving lane, vehicle speed, and acceleration). First, we propose a vehicular networking system to acquire the vehicle data by exchanging traffic data between the onboard unit and the roadside unit (RSU). Then, we predict the vehicle state at the edge cloud server (ECS) equipped at the RSU. Specifically, we utilize the autoregressive MA model to predict vehicle acceleration at the next moment. Then, the predicted vehicle acceleration is used as an input variable of the adaptive KF model to predict the vehicle location and speed at the next moment, in which we quantify the predicted vehicle location to the moving direction and the driving lane. Finally, the ECS broadcasts the predicted state to other RSUs. Through the communication with the road unit, all vehicles moving at the intersection can share vehicles states each other. In this doing, we can efficiently improve traffic safety in the intersection. We provide numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the autoregressive MA model used for predicting acceleration. Then, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed two-level quantized adaptive KF algorithm. Compared with five conventional prediction algorithms, our proposed algorithm can improve the speed prediction accuracy by 90.62%, 89.81%, 88.91%, 82.76%, and 70.77%, respectively, which implies that our algorithm is a promising scheme for predicting the vehicle state in vehicular networks.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2983332","Open Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University(grant numbers:2019D11); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LR16F010003,LR17F010002); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macao S.A.R.

Accurate and efficient congested link identification has become a foundational issue to IoT applications like self-driving cars, digital health, smart city, and so on. However, directly monitoring the massive number of interior links often introduces high operation cost or even is infeasible in practice, giving rise to indirect monitoring techniques like network Boolean tomography. Nevertheless, in many networks, the number of their interior links is larger than their end-to-end paths, making it very challenging for network Boolean tomography to find a determined solution. To resolve this issue, most of current methods try to utilize some prerequisites, such as the link congestion probabilities. While these probabilities might be hard or even unable to be obtained accurately in dynamical networks, limiting the practical deployment. In this paper, we are motivated to design a framework of congested link identification without any prerequisite or assumption. We first novelly model the congested link identification procedures as a Markov decision processes (MDPs), and then employ a reinforcement learning technology, i.e., Q-learning, to solve this MDP. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can autonomously and efficiently explore the unknown network environment, and is able to achieve better adaptivity and correctness, without any prior knowledge comparing to existing methods.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2930459","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB1003500); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61701074,61772480,61872310); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(grant numbers:19K20258); China University of Geosciences, Wuhan(grant numbers:G1323541861); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8769959","Congested link identification;end-to-end;network management;network tomography;reinforcement learning","Tomography;Monitoring;Internet of Things;Reinforcement learning;Loss measurement;Adaptation models;Cameras","Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;probability","bandwidth-hungry Internet of Things;congested link identification;unknown network environment;congested link identification procedures;dynamical networks;link congestion probabilities;end-to-end paths;network Boolean tomography;indirect monitoring techniques;interior links;IoT applications;Internet of Things applications;network congestion;Q-learning based framework","","9","","39","IEEE","23 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Different from the existing approaches, the proposed method transfers the latent representations from a source domain to a target domain in an adversarial way. The mapping functions in the target domain are learned by playing a min–max game with an adversarial loss, aiming to generate domain indistinguishable representations for a discriminator. Four neural architectural instances of ResSys-DAN are proposed and explored. Empirical results on real-world Amazon data show that, even without using labeled data (i.e., ratings) in the target domain, RecSys-DAN achieves competitive performance as compared to the state-of-the-art supervised methods. More importantly, RecSys-DAN is highly flexible to both unimodal and multimodal scenarios, and thus it is more robust to the cold-start recommendation which is difficult for the previous methods.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2907430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8698453","Adversarial learning;domain adaptation;imbalanced data;neural networks;recommender systems (RSs)","Generative adversarial networks;Gallium nitride;Recommender systems;Learning systems;Task analysis;Generators;Neural networks","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;recommender systems","discriminative adversarial networks;cross-domain recommender systems;representation learning;adversarial learning;domain adaptation;transfer learning methods;RecSys-DAN;data sparsity;source domain;adversarial loss;ResSys-DAN;Amazon data;latent representations;min-max game;data imbalance;neural architectural;mapping functions","","31","","52","IEEE","24 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, the research of CNN compression has recently become emerging. In this paper, we propose a novel filter pruning scheme, termed structured sparsity regularization (SSR), to simultaneously speed up the computation and reduce the memory overhead of CNNs, which can be well supported by various off-the-shelf deep learning libraries. Concretely, the proposed scheme incorporates two different regularizers of structured sparsity into the original objective function of filter pruning, which fully coordinates the global output and local pruning operations to adaptively prune filters. We further propose an alternative updating with Lagrange multipliers (AULM) scheme to efficiently solve its optimization. AULM follows the principle of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and alternates between promoting the structured sparsity of CNNs and optimizing the recognition loss, which leads to a very efficient solver (2.5× to the most recent work that directly solves the group sparsity-based regularization). Moreover, by imposing the structured sparsity, the online inference is extremely memory-light since the number of filters and the output feature maps are simultaneously reduced. The proposed scheme has been deployed to a variety of state-of-the-art CNN structures, including LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet, and GoogLeNet, over different data sets. Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods.

If the data stream is imbalanced, it is even more difficult to detect concept drifts and make an online learner adapt to them. Ensemble algorithms have been found effective for the classification of streaming data with concept drift, whereby an individual classifier is built for each incoming data chunk and its associated weight is adjusted to manage the drift. However, it is difficult to adjust the weights to achieve a balance between the stability and adaptability of the ensemble classifiers. In addition, when the data stream is imbalanced, the use of a size-fixed chunk to build a single classifier can create further problems; the data chunk may contain too few or even no minority class samples (i.e., only majority class samples). A classifier built on such a chunk is unstable in the ensemble. In this article, we propose a chunk-based incremental learning method called adaptive chunk-based dynamic weighted majority (ACDWM) to deal with imbalanced streaming data containing concept drift. ACDWM utilizes an ensemble framework by dynamically weighting the individual classifiers according to their classification performance on the current data chunk. The chunk size is adaptively selected by statistical hypothesis tests to access whether the classifier built on the current data chunk is sufficiently stable. ACDWM has four advantages compared with the existing methods as follows: 1) it can maintain stability when processing nondrifted streams and rapidly adapt to the new concept; 2) it is entirely incremental, i.e., no previous data need to be stored; 3) it stores a limited number of classifiers to ensure high efficiency; and 4) it adaptively selects the chunk size in the concept drift environment. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets containing concept drift show that ACDWM outperforms both state-of-the-art chunk-based and online methods.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2951814","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672444,61272366); Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), Research Committee, Initiation Grant—Faculty Niche Research Areas (IG-FNRA) 2018/2019(grant numbers:RC-FNRA-IG/18-19/SCI/03); Innovation and Technology Fund of the Innovation and Technology Commission of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR(grant numbers:ITS/339/18); Faculty Research Grant of HKBU(grant numbers:FRG2/17-18/082); Shenzhen Science, Technology and Innovation Committee (SZSTI)(grant numbers:JCYJ20160531194006833); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8924892","Concept drift;ensemble methods;imbalance learning;online learning","Thermal stability;Learning systems;Technological innovation;Detectors;Twitter;Bagging;Predictive models","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical testing","ensemble classifiers;size-fixed chunk;chunk-based incremental learning method;adaptive chunk-based dynamic weighted majority;ACDWM;nondrifted streams;concept drift environment;imbalanced data streams;online learning;classification stability;single classifier;majority class samples;statistical hypothesis tests","","20","","48","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, CNNs often cost significant memory and computation consumption, which prohibits their usage in resource-limited environments such as mobile or embedded devices. To address the above issues, the existing approaches typically focus on either accelerating the convolutional layers or compressing the fully-connected layers separatedly, without pursuing a joint optimum. In this paper, we overcome such a limitation by introducing a holistic CNN compression framework, termed LRDKT, which works throughout both convolutional and fully-connected layers. First, a low-rank decomposition (LRD) scheme is proposed to remove redundancies across both convolutional kernels and fully-connected matrices, which has a novel closed-form solver to significantly improve the efficiency of the existing iterative optimization solvers. Second, a novel knowledge transfer (KT) based training scheme is introduced. To recover the accumulated accuracy loss and overcome the vanishing gradient, KT explicitly aligns outputs and intermediate responses from a teacher (original) network to its student (compressed) network. We have comprehensively analyzed and evaluated the compression and speedup ratios of the proposed model on MNIST and ILSVRC 2012 benchmarks.

Conventional PIs rely on predetermining the lower and upper quantile proportions and therefore suffer from conservative interval width. This paper innovatively develops a chance constrained extreme learning machine (CCELM) model to generate quality nonparametric proportion-free PIs of wind power generation, which minimizes the expected interval width subject to the PI coverage probability constraint. Due to the independency on the preset PI bounds proportions, the proposed CCELM model merits high adaptivity and taps the latent potentialities for PI shortening. The convexity of extreme learning machine renders the sample average approximation counterpart of stochastic CCELM model equivalent to a parameter searching task in parametric optimization problem with polyhedral feasible region. A novel difference of convex functions optimization based bisection search (DCBS) algorithm is proposed to efficiently construct the CCELM model, which successfully realizes machine learning by means of solving linear programming problems sequentially. Comprehensive numerical experiments based on actual wind farm data demonstrate the significant effectiveness and efficiency of the developed CCELM model and DCBS algorithm.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2020.2986282","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0905000); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51877189,51761135015); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by China Association of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2018QNRC001); Hundred Talents Program of Zhejiang University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066877","Prediction interval;forecasting;wind power;chance constraint;extreme learning machine;DC optimization","Wind power generation;Forecasting;Optimization;Adaptation models;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty;Search problems","approximation theory;decision theory;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;optimisation;probability;stochastic processes;wind power;wind power plants","machine learning;actual wind farm data;developed CCELM model;chance constrained extreme learning machine;nonparametric prediction intervals;wind power generation;considerable intermittence;power system decision-making;conventional PIs;lower proportions;upper quantile proportions;conservative interval width;quality nonparametric proportion-free PIs;expected interval width subject;PI coverage probability constraint;preset PI;CCELM model merits high adaptivity;stochastic CCELM model","","42","","48","IEEE","14 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The power quality conditioners are widely used for solving the power quality issues in the railway power system. In power quality conditioners, the coupled impedance can affect the operation voltage, compensation range, and performance. Therefore, this article discusses the effect of different coupled impedances in conditioners, including fixed inductive impedance, fixed capacitive impedance, and adaptive impedance. Moreover, an adaptive impedance-coupled hybrid power quality conditioner (AI-HPQC) is proposed in comparison with inductive-coupled railway power quality compensator (RPC) and capacitive-coupled hybrid power quality conditioner (HPQC). Furthermore, a control method for the AI-HPQC is proposed for the coordination control of the adaptive impedance part and the active inverter part.

Following this footprint, the transportation sector is experiencing a paradigm shift and the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) has prodigious plausibility in reducing carbon emission. However, the anticipated EV penetration is hindered by several challenges, among them are their shorter driving range, slower charging rate and the lack of ubiquitous availability of charging locations, which collectively contribute to range anxieties for EVs' drivers. Meanwhile, the expected immense EV load onto the power distribution network may degrade the voltage stability. To reduce the range anxiety, we present a two-stage solution to provision and dimension a DC fast charging station (CS) network for the anticipated energy demand and that minimizes the deployment cost while ensuring a certain quality of experience for charging e.g., acceptable waiting time and shorter travel distance to charge. This solution also maintains the voltage stability by considering the distribution grid capacity, determining transformers’ rating to support peak demand of EV charging and adding a minimum number of voltage regulators based on the impact over the power distribution network. We propose, evaluate and compare two CS network expansion models to determine a cost-effective and adaptive CSs provisioning solution that can efficiently expand the CS network to accommodate future EV charging and conventional load demands. We also propose two heuristic methods and compare our solution with them. Finally, a custom built Python-based discrete event simulator is developed to test our outcomes.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2993509","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Concordia University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9090360","Charging station;electric vehicle;queuing theory;voltage stability","Cascading style sheets;Voltage control;Charging stations;Power system stability;Electric vehicle charging;Thermal stability;Urban areas;Global warming","air pollution control;battery powered vehicles;carbon compounds;discrete event simulation;electric vehicle charging;global warming;power distribution control;power grids;power system simulation;power system stability;Python;voltage regulators","electric vehicles fast charging infrastructure;smart city strives;carbon emission reduction;global warming;transportation sector;anticipated EV penetration;charging rate;charging locations;power distribution network;voltage stability;two-stage solution;DC fast charging station network;energy demand;heuristic method;Python-based discrete event simulator;demand-aware provisioning;cost-effective;load demands;CS network expansion models;voltage regulators;EV charging;peak demand;power transformers;distribution grid capacity;deployment cost","","24","","55","IEEE","8 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In contrast to long-packet communications in conventional wireless systems, SPC suffers from a transmission rate degradation and an unavoidable decoding error rate. Thus conventional resource allocation based on the Shannon capacity assuming infinite blocklength is no longer optimal. In this paper, we propose to use the effective-throughput as the performance metric to evaluate the tradeoff between the transmission rate and the decoding error rate. Building on that, we jointly optimize the subcarrier assignment, transmission power allocation, and transmission rate adaptation of each user to maximize the total weighted effective-throughput subject to transmission reliability and various practical constraints. Since the formulated problem belongs to a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we develop an efficient algorithm based on the dynamic programming (DP) recursion framework to obtain its optimal solutions. We further propose a low-complexity algorithm based on the principles of block coordinate descent (BCD) and concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed low-complexity algorithm can achieve similar performance as that of the optimal solution and outperform the other baseline schemes significantly.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2019.2960506","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61631005,61801101); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR; Research Committee of University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00156-FST); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936382","Short packet communications;multicarrier non-orthogonal multiple access;optimal resource allocation;dynamic programming","NOMA;Resource management;Decoding;Downlink;Error analysis;Silicon carbide;Heuristic algorithms","concave programming;convex programming;decoding;integer programming;multi-access systems;radio networks;resource allocation;telecommunication network reliability","optimal resource allocation;multicarrier NOMA;short packet communications;resource allocation problem;downlink multicarrier nonorthogonal multiple access systems;MC-NOMA-SPC;long-packet communications;conventional wireless systems;SPC suffers;transmission rate degradation;unavoidable decoding error rate;conventional resource allocation;transmission power allocation;transmission rate adaptation;effective-throughput subject;transmission reliability;nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming problem;dynamic programming recursion framework;low-complexity algorithm","","20","","44","IEEE","18 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
