However, despite these considerations, including our existing works, numerous challenges remain in the design and implementation of SCD roadmaps. One critical element for successful SCD is city systems integration, which necessitates cross-sectoral Business Process Change (BPC). However, limited attention has been given to addressing these challenges. To address this gap, our research builds upon and extends our prior works, utilising established principles and research findings to develop and validate a Framework for Addressing the BPC challenges for SCD (FABS). By undertaking a rigorous theoretical adaptation process and incorporating success factors, tools, techniques, and approaches from diverse domains, including enterprise systems, as well as conducting interviews and document analysis, our study contributes to the development of FABS. This empirically supported framework offers a systematic approach to effectively tackle BPC challenges in SCD, enabling smart city developers to assess their current SCD status and readiness for BPC, formulate their SCD roadmap, and assist solution providers in devising specialized tools and techniques tailored for SCD. Thus, our previous works have played a pivotal role in building the foundational components of this research’s outcome, namely the FABS framework, which has the potential to advance the field of smart city development.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3289213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10162190","Business process change;city processes;city systems integration;smart cities;smart city roadmap;urban systems","Smart cities;System integration;Business;System of systems;Real-time systems;Text analysis;Systems thinking;Business process management","business data processing;organisational aspects;smart cities","BPC challenges;city systems integration;cross-sectoral business process change;cross-sectoral business process change;enterprise systems;FABS;incorporating success factors;rigorous theoretical adaptation process;SCD roadmap;smart city developers;smart city development","","","","86","CCBYNCND","26 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, few studies have considered the impact of bus stops on CTSP under adaptive signal control. Near-side bus stops at an intersection and multiple transit vehicles arriving at the same bus stop affect the bus arrival prediction. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a Cooperative Transit signal priority method under Adaptive signal control considering bus Stops (CTAS). The queue prediction model is built with the real-time traffic data from the roadside perception system at intersections. The distance prediction model is built with real-time transit vehicles data, queue length, location of the bus stop, dwell time, and the preceding transit vehicles at the bus stop. Then the optimal signal timing plan is obtained by minimizing the total person delay. Finally, the rolling horizon strategy is utilized to continuously adjust the signal timing plan to adapt to changing traffic conditions. We verify the proposed method using measured data from an intersection in Changsha. The results indicate that our method achieves the best performance in terms of bus delay and person delay compared with the existing methods. It is an effective method to improve efficiency for transit vehicles and passengers.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3290992","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10168885","Adaptive signal control;bus stops;C-V2X;cooperative transit signal priority;person delay","Optimization;Real-time systems;Delays;Predictive models;Adaptation models;Connected vehicles;Data models;Adaptive signal processing","intelligent transportation systems;queueing theory;road traffic;road traffic control;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","adaptive signal control;bus arrival prediction;bus delay;bus stop;connected transit vehicles;multiple transit vehicles;near-side bus;optimal signal timing plan;person delay;preceding transit vehicles;real-time transit vehicles data;signalized intersections;Transit signal priority considering bus Stops;Transit signal priority method","","","","33","CCBYNCND","30 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such wide deployment of HAR systems often faces the annotation-scarcity challenge; that is, most of the HAR techniques, especially the deep learning techniques, require a large number of training data while annotating sensor data is very time- and effort-consuming. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been successfully applied to tackle this challenge, where the activity knowledge from a well-annotated domain can be transferred to a new, unlabelled domain. However, these existing techniques do not perform well on highly heterogeneous domains. This article proposes shift-GAN that integrate bidirectional generative adversarial networks (Bi-GAN) and kernel mean matching (KMM) in an innovative way to learn intrinsic, robust feature transfer between two heterogeneous domains. Bi-GAN consists of two GANs that are bound by a cyclic constraint, which enables more effective feature transfer than a classic, single GAN model. KMM is a powerful non-parametric technique to correct covariate shift, which further improves feature space alignment. Through a series of comprehensive, empirical evaluations, shift-GAN has not only achieved its superior performance over 10 state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques but also demonstrated its effectiveness in learning activity-independent, intrinsic feature mappings between two domains, robustness to sensor noise, and less sensitivity to training data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3053704","Italian MIUR, PRIN 2017 Project “Fluidware,”(grant numbers:N. 2017KRC7KT); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9333671","Human activity recognition;domain adaptation;ensemble learning;generative adversarial networks;covariate shift;kernel mean matching","Robot sensing systems;Accelerometers;Adaptation models;Kernel;Generative adversarial networks;Training data;Task analysis","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image matching;image motion analysis;neural nets;nonparametric statistics;sensors;unsupervised learning","unsupervised domain adaptation;GAN-based approach;sensor-based human activity recognition;HAR systems;annotation-scarcity challenge;HAR techniques;deep learning techniques;training data;sensor data annotation;activity knowledge;well-annotated domain;unlabelled domain;shift-GAN;Bi-GAN;intrinsic feature transfer;robust feature transfer;classic GAN model;single GAN model;nonparametric technique;state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques;intrinsic feature mappings;bidirectional generative adversarial networks;kernel mean matching;KMM;cyclic constraint;feature space alignment;sensor noise robustness","","16","","53","CCBY","22 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, LEDs are nonlinear loads, the massive usage will inject harmonics into the lighting system, which has influenced the power quality. Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is an important parameter to evaluate the power quality, but the prediction of THD for LEDs is a challenging task. This paper addresses this issue by designing harmonic characteristics detection experiment and using artificial intelligence algorithm. Firstly, LED lamps with different driving circuits were tested, the relevant data of each harmonic were sampled and analyzed. Then, a THD prediction method based on an improved AdaBoost algorithm is proposed. In this method, a Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model is established, and its parameters are optimized by Mind Evolution Algorithm (MEA) to improve the search ability of GRNN. On this basis, the AdaBoost algorithm is utilized to integrate multiple MEA-GRNN individuals to form a strong predictor, which improves the generalization ability of the model. To avoid the integration failure caused by improper selection of threshold value, a sigmoid adaptive factor is added to improve the accuracy of AdaBoost algorithm. Finally, the Ada-MEA-GRNN model is trained and simulated with the LED harmonic data collected by the experiment. The simulation results show that the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is better than BP and GRNN, which can reach 95.48%. Meanwhile, even if the input dimension is reduced, the error is still small.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3059483","Doctoral Scientific Research Foundation of Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture(grant numbers:ZF15054); Fundamental Research Funds for Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture(grant numbers:X18066); BUCEA Post Graduate Innovation Project(grant numbers:PG2020050); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9354632","LED lamps;THD prediction;ensemble learning;mind evolution algorithm (MEA);generalized regression neural network (GRNN)","Harmonic analysis;Lighting;Predictive models;LED lamps;Prediction algorithms;Power quality;Neurons","artificial intelligence;evolutionary computation;harmonic distortion;LED lamps;neural nets;power engineering computing;regression analysis","light-emitting diode;energy efficiency;nonlinear loads;lighting system;power quality;total harmonic distortion;artificial intelligence;LED lamps;driving circuits;THD prediction method;generalized regression neural network model;mind evolution algorithm;multiple MEA-GRNN individuals;generalization ability;Ada-MEA-GRNN model;LED harmonic data;prediction accuracy;harmonic characteristics detection;improved-AdaBoost algorithm;harmonic characteristics data-driven THD prediction;integration failure","","8","","34","CCBY","15 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to performance concerns, applications typically run in different clouds located in multiple sites. In different clouds, many factors, including electricity prices, available servers, and task service rates, exhibit spatial variations. Therefore, it is important to manage and schedule tasks among multiple clouds in a high-quality-of-service and low-energy-cost manner. This work proposes a task scheduling method to jointly minimize energy cost and average task loss possibility (ATLP) of clouds. A problem is formulated and tackled with an adaptive biobjective differential evolution based on simulated annealing to determine a real-time and near-optimal set of solutions. A final knee solution is further chosen to specify suitable servers in clouds and task allocation among web portals. Simulation results based on realistic data prove that less average loss possibility of tasks, and smaller energy cost is obtained with it than its widely used peers. Note to Practitioners—This work considers joint optimization of both ATLP and average energy cost of all clouds. It is of great significance to execute tasks among multiple clouds by jointly allocating all tasks among multiple web portals and specifying suitable servers in different clouds. Yet, it is challenging to achieve joint optimization in a market where factors, including prices of electricity and available servers, show spatial variations. Current studies are coarse-grained and fail to jointly achieve average energy cost minimization and quality-of-service optimization of tasks. In this work, a novel algorithm named adaptive simulated-annealing-based biobjective differential evolution is proposed for an energy cost and quality-of-service-optimized task scheduling strategy in a real-time manner. Experiments prove that it realizes lower energy cost and ATLP compared with its typical widely used peers. It can also be applied to other industrial areas, including smart manufacturing, Internet of Things, and smart city.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.3042409","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61802015,62073005); Major Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment of China(grant numbers:2018ZX07111005); National Defense Pre-Research Foundation of China(grant numbers:41401020401,41401050102); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9296374","Cloud computing;electricity market;multiobjective optimization;smart grid;task scheduling","Task analysis;Quality of service;Cloud computing;Servers;Data centers;Portals;Minimization","cloud computing;evolutionary computation;portals;power aware computing;quality of service;resource allocation;scheduling;simulated annealing;smart power grids","QoS-optimized adaptive task scheduling;cloud providers;task service rates;multiple clouds;low-energy-cost manner;adaptive biobjective differential evolution;task allocation;average loss possibility;joint optimization;average energy cost;Web portals;quality-of-service-optimized task scheduling strategy;energy efficiency;ATLP;Internet of Things;smart city;smart grid operators;simulated annealing","","13","","52","IEEE","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing GCN-based methods fail to capture internal implicit information when extracting action features, thereby leading to over-smoothing in the training stage. These issues result in poor performance and inaccurate extraction of action features. To address these problems, a new GCN is constructed. In this paper, a human skeleton feature optimizer (SFO) and adaptive structure enhancement graph convolution network (ASE-GCN) for action recognition are proposed in an end-to-end manner. To obtain discriminative features, the SFO is proposed to construct a new skeleton representation for action recognition through the connection criterion, which extracts the internal implicit information of action. The action feature of the joint coordinates is extracted by graph structure mask (GSM), directed graph mapping (DGM), and adaptive pooling operation (APO) in the proposed ASE-GCN network. The GSM acts as the regularizer of skeleton structure information to strengthen the representation of the graph structure. The DGM correlates the directed graph with human motion information through kinematic principle, and the APO strengthens the global high-frequency features to alleviate over-smoothing. The proposed method achieves comparable or superior results over state-of-the-art methods when used in experiments on two large public-scale datasets, NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics.","1558-2205","","10.1109/TCSVT.2022.3201186","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076117,61762061); Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Smart City(grant numbers:20192BCD40002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9866028","Action recognition;graph convolution network;skeleton feature optimizer;graph structure mask;directed graph mapping;adaptive pooling operation","Feature extraction;Skeleton;Convolution;Data mining;Directed graphs;Smart cities;Kernel","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;directed graphs;feature extraction;image enhancement;image motion analysis;image representation;optimisation;smoothing methods","action feature extraction;adaptive pooling operation;adaptive structure enhancement graph convolution network;ASE-GCN network;computer vision;DGM;directed graph mapping;discriminative features;GCN;graph structure mask;GSM;human action recognition;human motion information;human skeleton feature optimizer;kinematic principle;Kinetics dataset;NTU-RGB+D dataset;skeleton representation;skeleton structure information","","","","72","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a novel systematic beam control scheme is presented to tackle the beam management problem which is difficult due to the non-convex objective function. We employ double deep Q-network (DDQN) under a federated learning (FL) framework to address the above optimization problem, and thereby fulfilling adaptive and intelligent beam management in UDmmN. In the proposed beam management scheme based on FL (BMFL), the non-raw-data aggregation can theoretically protect user privacy while reducing handoff cost.

However, the increasing integration of the 6G network with the physical world leads to a plethora of new scenarios that bring new challenges to 6G, especially from the security and energy aspects. In 5G networks, security solutions across all devices and base stations are configured with universal settings for certain types of attacks. This one-size-fit-all strategy no longer suits 6G security due to the higher diversity in device capabilities, service features, energy conditions, attack vulnerabilities, and other time-varying attributes. Since each scenario may have unique security requirements and energy availability, the selection and configuration of security strategies need to be optimized for 6G networks in an adaptive and dynamic manner. In this article, we explore 6G security from an energy efficiency perspective by balancing the tradeoff between security and energy consumption in various scenarios. Specifically, we first investigate the AI-empowered 6G network architecture with promising applications and visions. Then we identify the challenges for adaptive and dynamic security optimization in 6G from the aspects of heterogeneity, dynamics, and modeling complexity. To balance security-energy trade-off, we propose an optimization framework that provides customized recommendations of security strategy to different user devices and base stations. Finally, open issues are discussed on 6G security from an energy efficiency perspective.","2471-2833","","10.1109/MCOMSTD.101.2000090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9579394","","6G mobile communication;Industries;Energy consumption;Base stations;Adaptive systems;Energy efficiency;Complexity theory","6G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;cellular radio;computer crime;energy conservation;energy consumption;power aware computing;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","security requirements;energy availability;energy efficiency;energy consumption;AI-empowered 6G network architecture;adaptive security;dynamic security;base stations;sixth generation cellular network;device capabilities;service features;one-size-fit-all strategy;security-energy trade-off;6G security;AI-empowered services;6G cellular network;5G networks;attack vulnerabilities;time-varying attributes;user devices","","8","","15","IEEE","18 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, control applications pose stringent quality of service requirements for reliable operation. Contrary to traditional ultra-reliable low-latency communications design goals such as low packet loss rates and low latency, research results in the domain of networked control systems (NCS) state that depending on the sampling period, control applications inherently tolerate a few consecutive packet losses. This translates into a better-suited metric to capture control application requirements and therefore a more conclusive design goal for wireless networks: ensuring a maximum age of information (AoI). With a Markov modeling approach, we propose to exploit the tolerance through a novel dynamic multi-connectivity scheme that we term state-aware resource allocation (SARA), which temporally negatively correlates packet losses, thus avoiding long packet loss sequences. Through statistical multiplexing, SARA enables a mean time to failure (MTTF) in the order of years while keeping the per-agent average channel usage close to one, also in a multi-agent setting with competition for resources. Compared with static dual-connectivity, the MTTF can be increased 100-fold whereas the number of required channels reduces by 40%. Our approach also statistically guarantees system-wide AoI distributions, which aid to ensure control performance.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2021.3095953","German Research Foundation (DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) as part of Germany’s Excellence Strategy–EXC 2050/1–Project ID 390696704–Cluster of Excellence “Centre for Tactile Internet with Human-in-the-Loop” (CeTI) of Technische Universität Dresden; European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program(grant numbers:101015956-“Hexa-X.”); Saxony/Germany; Center for Information Services and High Performance Computing (ZIH) at TU Dresden for generous allocations of computer time; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478879","Control communications co-design;age of information;wireless control;adaptive resource management;system analysis;availability","Wireless communication;Packet loss;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Resource management;5G mobile communication;Real-time systems;Optimal scheduling","closed loop systems;Markov processes;multi-agent systems;multiplexing;networked control systems;quality of service;resource allocation;telecommunication control;telecommunication network reliability;wireless channels","wireless networks;Markov modeling approach;dynamic multiconnectivity scheme;resource allocation;long packet loss sequences;system-wide AoI distributions;closed-loop control;industrial manufacturing;low packet loss rates;networked control systems state;NCS state;low-latency communications design;mean time to failure;MTTF;age of information;ultrareliable low-latency communications design;quality of service;multiagent setting","","4","","63","CCBY","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Multicarrier modulation techniques are one of the key components of the physical layer (PHY) design, which has immense potential to improve efficiency and reliability. In current state-of-the-art wireless technologies (i.e., NR and IEEE 802.11ax) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is used which has many disadvantages such as peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), out-of-band emission (OOBE), and sensitivity to carrier frequency offset (CFO). To overcome these drawbacks several alternate multicarrier modulation techniques are being considered, such as discrete Fourier transform-spread-OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM), and orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS). In this paper, we develop the physical layer abstraction (PLA) of these candidate multicarrier techniques to evaluate their performance under various use cases and scenarios. The PLA is a commonly used technique to avoid time-consuming PHY simulations in system-level simulators. To improve the accuracy of PLA in different fading conditions, we derive a fitting parameter as a function of the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) variance. The validation results show that performance can be accurately estimated through the proposed multicarrier PLA. Moreover, PLA techniques are at least thousands of times faster compared to PHY simulations.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2022.3168084","“Industrial Radio Lab Germany”(grant numbers:16KIS1010K); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9758749","Physical layer abstraction;system-level simulation;link adaptation;multicarrier modulation techniques;eEESM;EESM;RBIR;OFDM;DFT-s-OFDM;GFDM;OTFS","OFDM;Interference;Signal to noise ratio;Symbols;Programmable logic arrays;Fading channels;Modulation","5G mobile communication;discrete Fourier transforms;OFDM modulation;wireless LAN","physical layer performance modeling;modern multicarrier modulation techniques;diverse requirements;physical layer design;wireless technologies;IEEE 802.11ax;peak-to-average power ratio;out-of-band emission;carrier frequency;discrete Fourier transform-spread-OFDM;DFT-s-OFDM;orthogonal time-frequency space;physical layer abstraction;time-consuming PHY simulations;system-level simulators;multicarrier PLA;PLA techniques;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio variance;alternate multicarrier modulation techniques;fifth-generation beyond standards;5G beyond standards;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;generalized frequency division multiplexing;GFDM;fading conditions","","2","","30","IEEE","18 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The underpinnings of AttentionCode are three architectural innovations: AttentionNet, input restructuring, and adaptation to fading channels, accompanied by several training methods, including large-batch training, distributed learning, look-ahead optimizer, training-test signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) mismatch, and curriculum learning. The training methods can potentially be generalized to other wireless communication applications with machine learning. Numerical experiments verify that AttentionCode establishes a new state of the art among all DL-based feedback codes in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and fading channels. In AWGN channels with noiseless feedback, for example, AttentionCode achieves a block error rate (BLER) of 10−7 when the forward channel SNR is 0 dB for a block size of 50 bits, demonstrating the potential of AttentionCode to provide ultra-reliable short-packet communications.","1558-0857","","10.1109/TCOMM.2023.3280563","UKRI for the projects AIR (ERC-CoG, EP/X030806/1) and SONATA (EPSRCEP/W035960/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138113","Ultra-reliable short-packet communications;feedback;deep learning;the attention mechanism","Codes;Signal to noise ratio;Receivers;Training;Noise measurement;Fading channels;Feedforward systems","","","","","","38","IEEE","29 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, there is a crucial drop in performance when they are subject to learn new data incrementally in the absence of previous training data. They suffer from catastrophic forgetting—abrupt drop in performance. This phenomenon affects the implementation of artificial intelligence in practical scenarios. To overcome catastrophic forgetting, the previous method has either saved previous data in memory or generated the previous data. However, these methods are computationally complex and infeasible for real-time applications. In this article, we proposed the YOLOv3 as an object detection framework for incremental learning. A knowledge distillation loss is introduced for the prediction of previously learned knowledge without utilizing previous training data. Consequently, these predictions are updated while learning the current model.

Moreover, fractional-order (FO) calculus is incorporated into the control scheme to provide an extra degree of freedom for the parameter adjustments. The salient feature of the proposed control scheme is that the composite learning algorithm and FO calculus are integrated to achieve a satisfactory fault-tolerant formation-containment control performance even when a portion of leader/follower UAs is subjected to the actuator faults in a distributed communication network.

A common method to deal with this issue is to seek for a less expensive surrogate model to replace the original expensive objective function. However, this method also brings in model approximation error. To efficiently solve the EOP, a novel scale-adaptive fitness evaluation (SAFE) method is proposed in this article to directly evaluate the true fitness value of the solution on the original objective function. To reduce the computational cost, the SAFE method uses a set of evaluation methods (EM) with different accuracy scales to cooperatively complete the fitness evaluation process. The basic idea is to adopt the low-accuracy scale EM to fast locate promising regions and utilize the high-accuracy scale EM to refine the solution accuracy. To this aim, two EM switch strategies are proposed in the SAFE method to adaptively control the multiple EMs according to different evolutionary stages and search requirements. Moreover, a neighbor best-based evaluation (NBE) strategy is also put forward to evaluate the solution according to its nearest high-quality evaluated solution, which can further reduce computational cost. Extensive experiments are carried out on the case study of crowdshipping scheduling problem in the smart city to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SAFE method, and to investigate the effects of the two EM switch strategies and the NBE strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed SAFE method achieves better solution quality than some baseline and state-of-the-art algorithms, indicating an efficient method for solving EOP with a better balance between solution accuracy and computational cost.","1941-0026","","10.1109/TEVC.2021.3051608","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB2102102); Outstanding Youth Science Foundation(grant numbers:61822602); National Natural Science Foundations of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61772207,61873097); Key-Area Research and Development of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B010166002); Guangdong Natural Science Foundation Research Team(grant numbers:2018B030312003); Guangdong–Hong Kong Joint Innovation Platform(grant numbers:2018B050502006); Hong Kong GRFRGC General Research Fund(grant numbers:9042816,CityU 11209819); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9324797","Crowdshipping scheduling;expensive optimization problem (EOP);fitness evaluation (FE) method","Linear programming;Optimization;Computational efficiency;Iron;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Task analysis","adaptive control;approximation theory;genetic algorithms;scheduling;search problems;smart cities","expensive optimization problems;EOP;original objective function;SAFE method;evaluation methods;fitness evaluation process;EM switch strategies;scale-adaptive fitness evaluation method;approximation error.;neighbor best-based evaluation;NBE;adaptive control;evolutionary stages;search requirements;smart city;crowdshipping scheduling problem","","63","","60","CCBY","14 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The conventional evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs) in common sense have succeeded to conquer the uncertainties and external disturbance employing the specific variable structure characteristic. However, non-Gaussian noises would trigger the frequent changes of structure under the transient criteria, which severely degrades performance. Statistical criterion provides an informed choice of the strategies of the structure evolution, utilizing the approximation uncertainty as the observation of model sufficiency. The approximation uncertainty can be always decomposed into model uncertainty term and noise term, and is suitable for the non-Gaussian noise condition, especially relaxing the traditional Gaussian assumption. In this article, a novel incremental statistical evolving fuzzy inference system (SEFIS) is proposed, which has the capacity of updating the system parameters, and evolving the structure components to integrate new knowledge in the new process characteristic, system behavior, and operating conditions with non-Gaussian noises. The system generates a new rule based on the statistical model sufficiency which gives so insight into whether models are reliable and their approximations can be trusted. The nearest rule presents the inactive rule under the current data stream and further would be deleted without losing any information and accuracy of the subsequent trained models when the model sufficiency is satisfied. In our article, an adaptive maximum correntropy extend Kalman filter is derived to update the parameters of the evolving rules to cope with the non-Gaussian noises problems to further improve the robustness of parameter updating process. The parameter updating process shares an estimate of the uncertainty with the criteria of the structure evolving process to make the computation less of a burden dramatically. The simulation studies show that the proposed SEFIS has faster learning speed and is more accurate than the existing evolving fuzzy systems (EFSs) in the case of noise free and noisy conditions.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2021.3090898","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976172,12002254); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2020JQ-013,2020JM-072); Macao Young Scholar Program(grant numbers:AM201909); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9462345","Evolving fuzzy system;Kalman filter;maximum correntropy;model sufficiency","Uncertainty;Fuzzy systems;Fuzzy logic;Adaptation models;Kalman filters;Vibrations;Transient analysis","fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy systems;Gaussian noise;Kalman filters;learning (artificial intelligence);nonlinear filters;regression analysis","nonlinear system;specific variable structure characteristic;approximation uncertainty;model uncertainty term;noise term;nonGaussian noise condition;system parameters;statistical model sufficiency;parameter updating process;structure evolving process;noisy conditions;nonGaussian noise problems;incremental statistical evolving fuzzy inference system;adaptive maximum correntropy extend Kalman filter;SEFIS","","6","","32","IEEE","22 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The high-density parking lots using parking robots can greatly improve space utilization. However, there is a great collision risk in the parking lot's tight space navigation. So, precise LIDAR localization and trajectory tracking control are the key technologies of autonomous driving along a predetermined path. Due to the laser points’ sparse character, the LIDAR points’ extracted features have distribution errors. In order to further optimize the LIDAR's localization, this article establishes the feature's error ellipsoid model, and the model's information and error entropies are calculated separately. The error entropy is utilized to optimize the feature-matching weight and improve the localization accuracy. Based on the higher localization result, a state-of-the-art lateral tracking model is proposed to address the challenges faced by the long parking robot. Then, the adaptive fuzzy control is designed to achieve precise control of wheel motion. Finally, an experimental platform is built to compare the effectiveness of different positioning and tracking algorithms.

A Jensen–Shannon distance (JSD)-based thresholding filter is proposed to mitigate nonmeteorological signals, either in clear air or rain situations. This algorithm classifies range-Doppler bins into two classes, hydrometeors and nonhydrometeors, based on spectral polarimetric variable features. The result is a mask to be applied on the spectrograms. The variable selected here is the spectral co-polar correlation coefficient, available in dual-polarization and full polarimetric radars. The algorithm first does global thresholding by finding an optimized threshold value based on the averaged clear-air spectral polarimetric variable distribution. Next, classical filtering steps are carried out like a ground clutter notch filter around 0 ms−1, a mathematical morphology to fill gaps in the hydrometeor areas, and a removal of narrow Doppler power spectra. The second part of this article is the assessment of filtering techniques without ground truth. An assessment without ground truth is useful to select optimal algorithm configurations from a large solution space. Criteria of good filtering are defined both in the spectral and time domain. Based on those criteria, subjective and objective unsupervised evaluation metrics are derived, with a focus on the objective ones. Data, including clear air and rain collected from a full polarimetric Doppler X-band radar in the urban area, are used. With the proposed unsupervised evaluation metrics, the JSD-based thresholding filter is compared to two spectral polarimetric filters. Overall, the JSD-based filter performs very well considering both the subjective and the objective evaluation metrics.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2022.3200731","ATTRACT Project [Enhanced Urban Rain Surveillance Systems for Smart City Solutions (EU-RainS4)](grant numbers:777222); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9865152","Adaptive thresholding;dual-polarization weat-her radar;spectral polarimetric filtering of nonhydrometeors;unsupervised evaluation metrics","Radar;Radar polarimetry;Clutter;Doppler effect;Doppler radar;Measurement;Rain","atmospheric techniques;Doppler radar;geophysical image processing;image filtering;meteorological radar;notch filters;optical filters;radar clutter;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;rain;remote sensing by radar","narrow Doppler power spectra;ground truth;optimal algorithm configurations;good filtering;spectral time domain;subjective evaluation metrics;objective unsupervised evaluation metrics;clear air;rain;polarimetric Doppler X-band radar;JSD-based thresholding filter;spectral polarimetric filters;JSD-based filter;objective evaluation metrics;Jensen-Shannondistance-based filter;polarimetric weather radar processing;effective filtering technique;rainfall rate measurement;Jensen-Shannondistance-based thresholding filter;range-Doppler bins;hydrometeors;nonhydrometeors;spectral polarimetric variable features;co-polar correlation coefficient;dual-polarization;polarimetric radars;global thresholding;optimized threshold value;clear-air spectral polarimetric variable distribution;classical filtering steps;ground clutter notch filter;hydrometeor areas","","","","20","IEEE","23 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While nonlocal-based methods have shown promising performance in HSI denoising, most existing methods have only considered the LR property of the nonlocal full-band group while ignoring the strong correlation between sparse coefficients. Moreover, such methods often result in unsatisfactory visual artifacts due to the noise sensitivity of BM operations, while requiring expensive computations. To address these limitations, this article proposes a novel nonlocal structured sparsity regularization (NLSSR) approach for HSI denoising. First, to mitigate the noise sensitivity of the BM operation, we propose a graph-based domain distance scheme to index similar full-band patches to form the nonlocal full-band group. Second, we design an adaptive unidirectional LR dictionary with low complexity that takes into account the differences in intrinsic structure correlation among different modes of the nonlocal full-band tensor. Third, we utilize a global spectral LR prior to reduce spectral redundancy. Fourth, we develop a generalized soft-thresholding (GST) algorithm based on the alternating minimization framework to solve the NLSSR-based HSI denoising problem.

As time and progress have gradually shifted this concept from an idea into a reality, the possibilities for what services a smart city might provide have exploded. Along with that expansion, the number of devices that may need to be supported across a communications network has multiplied enormously. However, existing congestion control protocols are not equipped to support this higher requirement for network performance. New protocols are needed to provide higher data throughputs, reduce queuing delays and packet loss, and maintain stable and reliable communications pathways. The end-to-end congestion control protocol presented in this article does all these things. Called high throughput congestion control (HTCC), the framework takes full advantage of reinforcement learning and a fast growth algorithm to adaptively control the bytes in flight across the network's links to suit the prevailing network conditions. The result is a protocol that not only finds the optimal tradeoff between throughput, latency, and packet loss, but also significantly speeds up the learning process to avoid wasting network resources, use all free bandwidth and maximize network utilization. A comprehensive set of experiments with HTCC and six state-of-the-art protocols-Copa, PCC Vivace, PCC-Allegro, TCP Cubic, TaoVA-100x, and FillP-Sheep-demonstrate that, in most conditions, HTCC is able to make the best tradeoff between throughput, delay, and loss rate.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2020.3006199","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772377,61672257,91746206,61972296,61702380); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2042020kf0217); Science and Technology planning project of Shenzhen(grant numbers:JCYJ20170818112550194); Wuhan Advanced Application(grant numbers:2019010701011419); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9130878","Communication network;congestion control;deep reinforcement learning;smart city;smart city service","Protocols;Smart cities;Throughput;Delays;Reinforcement learning;Packet loss","adaptive control;learning (artificial intelligence);queueing theory;telecommunication congestion control;transport protocols","smart city communication networks;smart devices;communications network;congestion control protocols;network performance;higher data throughputs;packet loss;communications pathways;end-to-end congestion control protocol;throughput congestion control;reinforcement learning;prevailing network conditions;wasting network resources;network utilization","","11","","24","IEEE","1 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Prior approaches explore knowledge sharing between classes to improve performance of unsupervised domain adaption methods. However these methods have inductive bias for prior tree or graph. And previous contrastive domain adaptation methods take center-based prototypes as positive samples which only coarsely characterize the domain structure, and fail to depict the local data structure. To fix these problems, we propose a novel framework called contrastive memory feature transfer (CMFT). To solve nonshared data sharing without inductive bias, we build a centroid memory based directed memory transfer mechanism to enhance imbalanced class features with similar nonshared class centroid. To address the imbalanced domain adaptation, we design a fault-tolerant and fine-grained neighborhood prototype for the contrastive learning which can narrow the domain shift.

Besides, the related research is lacked. In this article, a novel unified framework of Wasserstein adversarial learning is proposed on identifying PQDs with incomplete data for the first time. It consists of WAI and WADA. WAI minimizes the improved Wasserstein distance between the data distributions of observed and generated PQD parts to impute missing values. During this process, PQD characteristics can be well recovered. Then, WADA leverages the Wasserstein domain discrepancy between the feature distributions of source labeled complete and target unlabeled imputed PQDs to capture domain-invariant features. Thus, labels of target imputed PQDs can be predicted accurately. Experimental verification demonstrates that the proposed WAI and WADA outperform other typical methods with better imputation results and higher classification accuracy.

The great challenge facing video object detection is the simultaneous requirements on both accuracy and speed because the pursuit of one aspect usually causes significant expense to the other. Most existing methods mainly focus on improving detection accuracy with little attention to computationally efficient solutions, and thus they are impractical for many real-world applications. This motivates us to develop a real-time and high-accuracy video object detection method. In this paper, we propose a novel video object detector, called FastVOD-Net, which can yield highly accurate detection results at real-time speed. Specifically, we first develop a temporally-cascaded deformable alignment (TCDA) module to model the object displacements induced by video motion. Then, we introduce another two modules, namely spatially-refined temporal aggregation (SRTA) and attention-guided semantic distillation (AGSD), to improve the appearance feature of the currently processed frame and enhance the semantic representation of non-keyframes, respectively. For keyframe scheduling, we design an adaptive keyframe selection scheduler (AKSS) to adjust the keyframe interval online, making the keyframe usage more rational. On one hand, the characteristics of our FastVOD-Net enable it to sparsely perform expensive feature extraction, which significantly reduces the computational cost and thus guarantees real-time speed. On the other hand, the collaboration of the above tightly-coupled modules and adaptive keyframe scheduler makes FastVOD-Net fully exploit inter-frame temporal dependencies and thus guarantees high accuracy. Experiments on the ImageNet VID dataset show that our FastVOD-Net achieves 79.3% mAP at 29.6 fps or 81.2% mAP at 23.0 fps on an Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti GPU, which is the state-of-the-art performance in real time.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2022.3176721","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21A20514,61872307,62071404); Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province(grant numbers:2020J01001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9785382","Video object detection;temporal aggregation;adaptive keyframe scheduling;real-time detection","Object detection;Streaming media;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Detectors;Task analysis;Semantics","feature extraction;image sequences;object detection;video signal processing","adaptive keyframe scheduler;adaptive keyframe selection scheduler;appearance feature;called FastVOD-Net;computationally efficient solutions;deformable alignment module;detection accuracy;FastVOD-Net achieves;great challenge facing video object detection;guarantees real-time speed;high-accuracy video object detection method;high-accuracy video object detector;highly accurate detection results;keyframe interval online;keyframe scheduling;keyframe usage;nonkeyframes;object displacements;rapid motion;severe appearance degradation;sudden occlusion;temporal aggregation;video motion","","3","","70","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Experimental results indicate that the algorithms have the potential to improve traffic flow efficiency and allocate more space for pedestrians. Furthermore, the distributive learning algorithm outperforms its centralised counterpart regarding computational cost (49.55%), benchmark rewards (25.35%), best cumulative rewards (24.58%), optimal actions (13.49%) and rate of convergence.

Existing models especially deep learning based approaches require a large volume of training data, whose performance may degrade remarkably when the data is scarce. Recent works try to transfer knowledge from the intra-city or cross-city multi-modal spatio-temporal data. However, the careful design of what to transfer and how between the multi-modal spatio-temporal data needs to be determined in advance. There still lacks an end-to-end solution that can automatically capture the common cross-domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Deep Attentive Adaptation Network model named ST-DAAN to transfer cross-domain Spatio-Temporal knowledge for urban crowd flow prediction. ST-DAAN first maps the raw spatio-temporal data of source domain and target domain to a common embedding space. Then domain adaptation is adopted on several domain-specific layers through adding a domain discrepancy penalty to explicitly match the mean embeddings of the two domain distributions. Considering the complex spatial correlation in many urban spatio-temporal data, a global attention mechanism is also designed to enable the model to capture broader spatial dependencies. Using urban crowd flow prediction as a demonstration, we conduct experiments on five real-world large datasets over both intra- and cross-city transfer learning. The results demonstrate that ST-DAAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2021.3055207","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1003900); HK RGC Collaborative Research Fund(grant numbers:C5026-18G); HK RGC Research Impact Fund(grant numbers:R5034-18); CCF-Tencent Open Research Fund; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:NZ2020014); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9352560","Spatio-temporal data;transfer learning;urban computing;crowd flow prediction","Urban areas;Predictive models;Transfer learning;Data models;Deep learning;Task analysis;Adaptation models","behavioural sciences computing;deep learning (artificial intelligence);smart cities;traffic engineering computing","urban crowd flow prediction;ST-DAAN;domain adaptation;cross-city transfer learning;urban computing tasks;smart city applications;traffic congestion prediction;cross-city multimodal spatio-temporal data;common cross-domain knowledge;embedding space;domain discrepancy penalty;spatial correlation;global attention mechanism;deep attentive adaptation network model;cross-domain spatio-temporal knowledge transfer","","12","","46","IEEE","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key is to increase the chance of going through green lights and avoid idling at red lights. Existing works for velocity planning fail to fully consider various realistic traffic conditions, such as interfering traffic, free lane switch, and group efficiency, thus compromising effectiveness and limiting feasibility. To address all the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel method DeepGAL for vehicle control by dividing vehicles into groups, assigning a leader in each group and delivering intelligent control on leaders with deep reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments are conducted based on two real-world datasets with distinct traffic flow rates in Hangzhou, China, and the results demonstrate that DeepGAL achieves outstanding improvement over various performance metrics applied in five classic car following models considering realistic traffic conditions. Moreover, DeepGAL outperforms four state-of-the-art baseline methods over various metrics under both light and heavy real-world traffic flows. The test of DeepGAL with indeterministic traffic-signal phase and timing (SPAT) information under an adaptive traffic signal control indicates its effectiveness even with partial SPAT information. In addition, considering the practical issue that only some of the vehicles can be controlled by our scheme, we conduct simulations on different penetration levels of controlled leader vehicles, which demonstrate that even with only 10% penetration, DeepGAL can notably alleviate congestion and enhance driving experience at intersections, validating its great feasibility.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3257199","Innovation and Technology Fund of Hong Kong(grant numbers:ITS/447/16); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10104205","Intersection congestion;vehicle control;deep reinforcement learning;intelligent transportation system;smart city","Adaptation models;Roads;Automobiles;Traffic congestion;Reinforcement learning;Switches;Limiting","deep learning (artificial intelligence);intelligent control;intelligent transportation systems;reinforcement learning;road traffic;road traffic control;road vehicles;telecommunication traffic;traffic engineering computing","adaptive traffic signal control;aforementioned issues;controlled leader vehicles;deep reinforcement learning;delivering intelligent control;distinct traffic flow rates;driving experience improvement;free lane switch;green lights;green time resources;group efficiency;heavy real-world traffic flows;indeterministic traffic-signal phase;intelligent vehicle control;limiting feasibility;making competent speed plans;novel method DeepGAL;outstanding improvement;realistic traffic conditions;red lights;state-of-the-art baseline methods;traffic congestion alleviation;urban areas;velocity planning","","","","41","IEEE","18 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The stay-home quarantine is an effective way to reduce physical contacts and the associated COVID-19 transmission risk, which requires the support of efficient living materials (such as meats, vegetables, grain, and oil) delivery. Notably, the presence of potential infected individuals increases the COVID-19 transmission risk during the delivery. The deliveryman may be the medium through which the virus spreads among urban residents. However, traditional delivery route optimization methods don’t take the virus transmission risk into account. Here, we propose a novel living material delivery route approach considering the possible COVID-19 transmission during the delivery. A complex network-based virus transmission model is developed to simulate the possible COVID-19 infection between urban residents and the deliverymen. A bi-objective model considering the COVID-19 transmission risk and the total route length is proposed and solved by the hybrid meta-heuristics integrating the adaptive large neighborhood search and simulated annealing. The experiment was conducted in Wuhan, China to assess the performance of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that 935 vehicles will totally travel 56,424.55 km to deliver necessary living materials to 3,154 neighborhoods, with total risk  $\delta ~404.25$ .

In IoV, the network topology changes based on drivers' destination, intent or vehicles' movements and road structure on which the vehicles travel. In IoV, vehicles are assumed to be equipped with computing devices to process data, storage devices to store data and communication devices to communicate with other vehicles or with roadside infrastructure (RSI). It is vital to authenticate data in IoV to make sure that legitimate data is being propagated in IoV. Thus, security stands as a vital factor in IoV. The existing literature contains some limitations for robust security in IoV such as high delay introduced by security algorithms, security without privacy, unreliable security and reduced overall communication efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) based Ant Colony Optimization Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (ACO-AODV) routing protocol which avoids suspicious vehicles during message dissemination in IoV. Specifically, our proposed protocol comprises three components: i) certificate authority (CA) which maps vehicle's publicly available info such as number plates with cryptographic keys using ECC; ii) malicious vehicle (MV) detection algorithm which works based on trust level calculated using status message interactions; and iii) secure optimal path selection in an adaptive manner based on the intent of communications using ACO-AODV that avoids malicious vehicles.

However, the data scarcity of IoT hinders the effectiveness of traditional intrusion detection methods. To tackle this issue, in this article, we propose the adaptive bi-recommendation and self-improving network (ABRSI) based on unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). The ABRSI transfers enrich intrusion knowledge from a data-rich network intrusion source domain to facilitate effective intrusion detection for data-scarce IoT target domains. The ABRSI achieves fine-grained intrusion knowledge transfer via adaptive bi-recommendation matching. Matching the bi-recommendation interests of two recommender systems (RSs) and the alignment of intrusion categories in the shared feature space form a mutual-benefit loop. Besides, the ABRSI uses a self-improving mechanism, autonomously improving the intrusion knowledge transfer from four ways. A hard pseudo label (PL) voting mechanism jointly considers RS decision and label relationship information to promote more accurate hard PL assignment. To promote diversity and target data participation during intrusion knowledge transfer, target instances failing to be assigned with a hard PL will be assigned with a probabilistic soft PL, forming a hybrid pseudo-labeling strategy. Meanwhile, the ABRSI also makes soft pseudo-labels globally diverse and individually certain. Finally, an error knowledge learning mechanism is utilized to adversarially exploit factors that causes detection ambiguity and learns through both current and previous error knowledge, preventing error knowledge forgetfulness. Holistically, these mechanisms form the ABRSI model that boosts IoT intrusion detection accuracy via HDA-assisted intrusion knowledge transfer. Comprehensive experiments on several intrusion data sets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the ABRSI method, outperforming its counterparts by 9.2%, and also verify the effectiveness of ABRSI constituting components and ABRSI’s overall efficiency.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3262458","Third Xinjiang Scientific Expedition Program(grant numbers:2021xjkk1300); Science and Technology Development Fund of Macao SAR (FDCT)(grant numbers:1058No.0015/2019/AKP); Chinese Academy of Sciences President’s International Fellowship Initiative(grant numbers:2023VTA0001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10082914","Adaptive bi-recommendation (ABR);domain adaptation (DA);Internet of Things (IoT);intrusion detection;self-improving (SI)","Internet of Things;Knowledge transfer;Intrusion detection;Knowledge engineering;Recommender systems;Adaptive systems;Probabilistic logic","computer network security;Internet of Things;recommender systems;unsupervised learning","ABRSI constituting components;ABRSI method;ABRSI model;accurate hard PL assignment;adaptive bi-recommendation matching;bi-recommendation interests;current error knowledge;data scarcity;data-rich network intrusion source domain;data-scarce IoT target domains;detection ambiguity;effective intrusion detection;enrich intrusion knowledge;error knowledge forgetfulness;error knowledge learning mechanism;fine-grained intrusion knowledge transfer;hard pseudolabel;HDA-assisted intrusion knowledge transfer;heterogeneous domain adaptation-assisted IoT intrusion detection;hybrid pseudolabeling strategy;intrusion categories;intrusion data sets;IoT intrusion detection accuracy;malicious intrusions;previous error knowledge;recommender systems;self-improving network;shared feature space form;soft pseudolabels;target data participation;Things devices;traditional intrusion detection methods;unsupervised heterogeneous domain adaptation","","","","42","IEEE","27 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Playing a vital role in ITS, railway systems have been integrating with multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices to monitor real-time inbound passenger flows to ensure pedestrian safety. But it remains difficult to consolidate real-time information from different IoT sources and accurately estimate the future flow due to the coarse-grained data, potential impacts of dynamic interchanged passengers, and real-time predictive capability, which have greatly hindered the progress of ITS transformation in smart cities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a two-stage self-adaptive model for accurately and timely predicting passenger flow in metropolitan railway systems. In the first stage, a self-attention-based prediction model is introduced to predict the next-day passenger flow based on the historical boarding records captured by IoT devices. The proposed decomposing components transferring the discrete boarding records into continuous patterns enable the module to deliver a robust minute-level prediction. In the second stage, a real-time fine-tuning model is developed to adjust the predicted passenger flow based on real-time emergencies and short-term changes in passenger flows from IoT devices. The combination of an offline deep learning mechanism and a real-time reallocation algorithm ensures the real-time response without loss of accuracy.

Combined with phase retrieval algorithms, the magnitudes of linear measurements obtained from the distorted OAM beams modulated with a series of random amplitude masks and focused by a lens are employed for the phase estimation. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive performance comparison against state-of-the-art phaseless wave-front sensing techniques.

In view of the recent advances in IoT devices and the emerging new breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), the fog radio access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN (C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs) coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and smart city environments.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3091674","U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:ECCS-2029875); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9463417","Deep reinforcement learning (DRL);edge computing;fog RAN;intelligent vehicular systems;network slicing","Network slicing;Smart cities;Cloud computing;Resource management;Quality of service;Vehicle dynamics;Ultra reliable low latency communication","5G mobile communication;artificial intelligence;cloud computing;intelligent transportation systems;Internet of Things;Markov processes;radio access networks;reinforcement learning;resource allocation;smart cities;telecommunication computing","adaptive network slicing;intelligent vehicular systems;smart cities;smart city applications;Internet-of-Things implementations;compound annual growth rate;IoT devices;emerging new breed;IoT applications;artificial intelligence;fog radio access network;F-RAN;fifth-generation wireless communications;5G;latency limitations;cloud-RAN;C-RAN;network slicing problem;network edge;fog nodes;vehicular city users;smart city users;dynamic environments;edge controller;infinite-horizon Markov decision process;deep reinforcement learning solution;optimal slicing policy;slicing approaches;DRL-based EC;automated network;dynamic vehicular city environments;smart city environments","","24","","55","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It bridges the gap between the information world and the real world. With the data-based feature, the security and credibility of the IoT mainly depend on whether the source of the data is trusted. Therefore, as the data collection and transmission entity, sensing nodes should be classified and proved the trustworthiness. However, the existing works failed to classify and measure the credibility of sensing nodes multidimensional in real time. The previous trust-proof methods also cannot effectively protect the key information. To address these problems, this article first proposes a multidimensional and fine-grained dynamic measurement method in a trusted computing environment. Then, a trust classification model of sensing nodes is presented, and a grouping mechanism of different trust levels is designed to identify malicious nodes. Finally, a threshold ring signature-based trust certification scheme is proposed for data source authentication. It can adequately protect the privacy information of the attestation node and has complete anonymity and traceability. Besides, the scheme has a shorter signature and high computational efficiency, which makes it also suitable for sensing nodes with limited computing resources.

Space–air–ground-integrated network (SAGIN) is widely believed to be an ideal infrastructure for connecting IoV. In this article, we present an approach for understanding the security issues of complex IoT systems, and propose a security reference architecture for assessing security risks and addressing the security requirements. Specifically, we propose an activity-network-things (ANT)-centric security reference architecture, which is based on the three architectural perspectives in studying IoT systems, namely, device, Internet, and semantic. We discuss the limitations of existing IoT system architecture models, which are mainly evolved from the enterprise system architecture with some adaptation to the inherent features of IoT systems. Our approach can help manage the security risks by focusing on the critical activities performed in different microperimeters within an IoT system. The proposed architecture includes an organized process to understand the security requirements and select specific parameters for tailored security controls that are commensurate with organization-specific and application-specific security impacts of IoT.

Considering the privacy leakage and limited communication resources, federated learning (FL) has emerged to enable devices to collaboratively train AI models based on their local data without raw data exchanges. Nevertheless, it is still challenging for guaranteeing any FL models to be effective due to the sluggish willingness of IoT devices and the model poisoning attacks in the FL. To address these issues, in this article, we introduce blockchain technology and propose a blockchain-based FL framework for supporting a trustworthy and reliable FL paradigm in IoT. In the proposed framework, we design a committee-based participant selection mechanism that selects the aggregate node and local model updates dynamically to construct the global model. Moreover, considering the tradeoff between the energy consumption and the convergence rate of the FL model, we perform the channel allocation, block size adjustment, and block producer selection jointly. Since the remaining resources, handling transactions, and channel conditions are dynamically varying (i.e., stochastic environment), we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and adopt a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to solve it. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show the superior performance of the DRL-based resource allocation algorithm compared with other baseline methods in terms of energy consumption.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2023.3241318","National Natural Science Foundation for Young Scientists of China(grant numbers:62001050); Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program by CAST(grant numbers:2021QNRC001); Open Research Project Programme of the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City (University of Macau)(grant numbers:SKL-IoTSC(UM)-2021-2023/ORPF/SA02/2022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10034764","Blockchain;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);federated learning (FL);Internet of Things (IoT);resource allocation","Internet of Things;Blockchains;Training;Resource management;Performance evaluation;Servers;Data models","artificial intelligence;blockchains;channel allocation;computer network security;data privacy;deep learning (artificial intelligence);energy consumption;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;reinforcement learning;resource allocation;telecommunication computing","adaptive resource allocation;aggregate node;AI models;artificial intelligence technologies;block producer selection;blockchain technology;blockchain-based federated learning;blockchain-based FL framework;channel allocation;committee-based participant selection mechanism;DRL-based resource allocation algorithm;energy consumption;FL model;global model;intelligent tasks;IoT devices;limited communication resources;local model updates;mobile communication;privacy leakage;raw data exchanges;reliable FL paradigm;remaining resources;trustworthy FL paradigm","","","","56","IEEE","1 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This can be determined, for example, from mobile sensors in a smart city environment or wearable devices carried by pedestrians. If we consider infrastructure networks, frequently changing the coverage cell may lead to service disruptions if a predictive approach is not deployed in the system. All predictive systems are based on the storage of old mobility samples to adequately train the model. Our focus is based on the possibility to determine an approach for adaptively sampling mobility patterns based on the intrinsic features of the human/node behavior. Several works in the literature examine mobility prediction mobile networks, but all of them are dedicated to the study of time features in mobility traces: none took into account the spectral content of historical mobility patterns for predictive purposes. In contrast, we take into account this spectral content in mobility samples. Through a set of wavelet transforms, we adapted the sampling frequency dynamically and obtained a considerable set of advantages (space, energy, accuracy, etc.). In fact, this issue covers an important role in the IoT paradigm, where energy consumption is one of the main variables requiring optimization (frequent and unnecessary mobility samplings can disrupt battery life).

Network performance analyses must be carefully addressed, usually through simulation software. Because of the large-scale nature of the IoT, traditional simulation methods do not scale well. Thus, in this article, we present two original contributions that provide scalability to network performance simulations. First, we introduce the concept of multi-layered analysis for large-scale networks and, second, we provide a method to quickly associate propagation measures to user equipment. The proposed concept is based on the de-coupling of the access and the user layer and the introduction of a so-called grid layer created by pre-computing propagation measures in the considered area. These propagation data are then ready to be used in the network performance simulation. To show the efficacy of the proposed approach, several realistic use cases are analyzed along with a comparison of the time needed to simulate with and without our grid-based methodology. Numerical results show that a significant reduction of computational time is achieved by employing our approach, especially in large-scale networks. Experiments were also performed to study the trade-off between grid granularity, RSS precision errors and computational time, showing that the method can be flexibly adapted to the planners' requests.","2576-3199","","10.1109/IOTM.001.2200156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10070412","","Performance evaluation;Adaptation models;Mesh networks;Computational modeling;Scalability;Wireless networks;Throughput","cellular radio;computer network security;Internet of Things;RSSI;telecommunication traffic","advanced cellular networks;computational time;grid layer;grid-based methodology;increasingly large smart-city;large-scale nature;large-scale networks;layered based methodology;meeting communication requirements;multilayered analysis;network performance analyses;network performance simulation;original contributions;performance simulations;pre-computing propagation measures;propagation data;simulate IoT traffic;simulation software;trade-off between grid granularity;traditional simulation methods;user equipment;user layer","","1","","15","IEEE","14 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The large volume of complex traffic and the uncertainty of market supplies/demands have made it essential for many MOD service providers to proactively dispatch vehicles towards ride-seekers. To meet this need effectively, we propose STRide, an MOD coordination learning mechanism reinforced spatio-temporally with capsules. We formalize the adaptive coordination of vehicles into a reinforcement learning framework. STRide incorporates spatial and temporal distributions of supplies (vehicles) and demands (ride requests), customers’ preferences and other external factors. A novel spatio-temporal capsule neural network is designed to predict the provider’s rewards based on MOD network states, vehicles and their dispatch actions.

Although state-of-the-art methods apply image-to-image translation or web data to achieve data augmentation, the construct of new datasets will not only introduce noise, but also undergo a mismatch issue with the source domain. Moreover, the label noise of cross-domain data in existing label distribution technologies cannot be alleviated. In this paper, a multi-domain joint learning with inter-domain adaptation label smoothing regularization (IALSR) is proposed using a semi-supervised learning framework. The overall framework consists of two parts. In one part, a multi-domain joint network (MJNet) is proposed to learn multiple vehicle attributes simultaneously. The output of the training model is employed to group several inter-domain subsets, which are regarded as different domains. To adapt to domain diversities, style transfer models are learned for each pair of subsets to generate free and rich data as a novel data augmentation approach. In the other part, IALSR, which preserves self-similarity and domain-transitivity, is designed to smooth the noise of style-transferred data. Upon our basis, we further introduce the web data to verify the superiority of the IALSR. The results of extensive experimental on two large-scale vehicle Re-ID datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to other state-of-the-art ones.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2021.3104141","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076117,61762061); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:20161ACB20004); Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Smart City(grant numbers:20192BCD40002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9513554","Vehicle re-identification;domain adaptation;semi-supervised learning;multi-domain joint network;inter-domain adaptation label smoothing regularization","Training;Semisupervised learning;Cameras;Training data;Data models;Adaptation models;Smoothing methods","intelligent transportation systems;Internet;knowledge based systems;object recognition;road vehicles;semi-supervised learning (artificial intelligence);smoothing methods;traffic engineering computing;video surveillance","urban intelligent video surveillance;self-similarity;MJNet;domain-transitivity;data augmentation;style transfer;multidomain joint network;semisupervised learning framework;IALSR;inter-domain adaptation label smoothing regularization;multidomain joint learning;Web data;vehicle re-identification","","13","","44","IEEE","13 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing methods mainly constructed counters in parallel perspective, but when facing complex perspective, such as the influences of height difference and heavy occlusions, they fail to get good accuracy. To alleviate these problems, this work proposes a novel and interesting framework NOOMP (Need Only One More Point) for perspective adaptation crowd counting task in complex nature scenes. Firstly, this work considers that the common scenes in our daily life usually have the height difference, which brings complex perspective to crowd counting. So, a new labeled method, Absolute-geometry Gaussian Generation is proposed, which only needs one more point for each person in image and gets better accuracy. Secondly, the NOOMP framework consists of meta-learning structure and uses the few-shot way to train the counting model, which can implement the perspective adaptation effective and solve the problem of high label cost. Thirdly, for fitting the characteristic of few-shot learning, this work proposes a new Multi-head Parallel Network (MPNet) for NOOMP. The feature of crowd is extracted by MPNet, which is a hybrid structure composed of shallow network and deep network. This network can save the features of shallow network and the deeper network effectively, which makes MPNet performs well in NOOMP. In addition, this work collects a new dataset, named Multiple Height Differences in Mall (MHDM) for NOOMP, which contains images of different views and height differences from shopping malls and supermarkets. Experiments based on MHDM and other benchmarks show that the NOOMP has good performances in model accuracy and works well for solving perspective change problem.","1941-0077","","10.1109/TMM.2022.3230337","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076117,62166026); Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Smart City(grant numbers:20192BCD40002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9992082","Crowd counting;multi-head parallel network;need only one more point;perspective-adaptive","Adaptation models;Training;Task analysis;Labeling;Computer science;Kernel;Feature extraction","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural scenes;object detection","common scenes;complex nature scenes;complex perspective;complex scenes;counting model;crowd counting problem;height difference;interesting framework NOOMP;Multihead Parallel Network;named Multiple Height Differences;NOOMP framework;novel framework NOOMP;parallel perspective;perspective adaptation crowd counting;perspective adaptation effective;perspective change problem;shallow network","","1","","47","IEEE","19 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To provide an adaptive virtual resource orchestration, the integration of software-defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), EC, and double deep q-networks is emerged, which accurately gathers the state observation from local and edge nodes in data plane and NFV infrastructure (NFVI) for applying actions of allocated resource predetermination and recommended offloading policy.

Motivated by the aforementioned discussions, we present a Privacy-Preserving and Secure Framework (PPSF) for IoT-driven smart cities. The proposed PPSF is based on two key mechanisms: a two-level privacy scheme and an intrusion detection scheme. First, in a two-level privacy scheme, a blockchain module is designed to securely transmit the IoT data and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique is applied to transform raw IoT information into a new shape. In the intrusion detection scheme, a Gradient Boosting Anomaly Detector (GBAD) is applied for training and evaluating the proposed two-level privacy scheme based on two IoT network datasets, namely ToN-IoT and BoT-IoT. We also suggest a blockchain-InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) integrated Fog-Cloud architecture to deploy the proposed PPSF framework.

However, the cloud-assisted approaches suffer from the unreliable and delay-significant wide-area network, and the local computing approaches are limited by the constrained computing capability. Towards high-performance edge intelligence, the cooperative execution mechanism offers a new paradigm, which has attracted growing research interest recently. In this paper, we propose CoEdge, a distributed DNN computing system that orchestrates cooperative DNN inference over heterogeneous edge devices. CoEdge utilizes available computation and communication resources at the edge and dynamically partitions the DNN inference workload adaptive to devices' computing capabilities and network conditions. Experimental evaluations based on a realistic prototype show that CoEdge outperforms status-quo approaches in saving energy with close inference latency, achieving up to 25.5% ~ 66.9% energy reduction for four widely-adopted CNN models.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2020.3042320","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U20A20159,U1711265,61972432); Program for Guangdong Introducing Innovative and Entrepreneurial Teams(grant numbers:2017ZT07X355); Guangdong Provincial Pearl River Talents Program(grant numbers:2017GC010465); U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1838024,EEC-1801727,CNS-1950485); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9296560","Edge intelligence;cooperative DNN inference;distributed computing;energy efficiency","Image edge detection;Computational modeling;Smart homes;Performance evaluation;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Runtime","cloud computing;multiprocessing systems;neural nets;resource allocation","CoEdge;adaptive workload partitioning;heterogeneous edge devices;artificial intelligence;intelligent applications;network edge;smart home;smart factory;smart city;computationally intensive Deep Neural Networks;resource-constrained edge devices;offloading workload;remote cloud;end device;cloud-assisted approaches;local computing approaches;constrained computing capability;high-performance edge intelligence;distributed DNN computing system;DNN inference workload;network conditions","","47","","60","IEEE","16 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

NRL, also known as network embedding, aims at preserving graph structures in a low-dimensional space. These learned representations can be used for subsequent machine learning tasks, such as vertex classification, link prediction, and data visualization. Recently, graph convolutional network (GCN)-based models, e.g., GraphSAGE, have drawn a lot of attention for their success in inductive NRL. When conducting unsupervised learning on large-scale graphs, some of these models employ negative sampling (NS) for optimization, which encourages a target vertex to be close to its neighbors while being far from its negative samples. However, NS draws negative vertices through a random pattern or based on the degrees of vertices. Thus, the generated samples could be either highly relevant or completely unrelated to the target vertex. Moreover, as the training goes, the gradient of NS objective calculated with the inner product of the unrelated negative samples and the target vertex may become zero, which will lead to learning inferior representations. To address these problems, we propose an adversarial training method tailored for unsupervised inductive NRL on large networks. For efficiently keeping track of high-quality negative samples, we design a caching scheme with sampling and updating strategies that has a wide exploration of vertex proximity while considering training costs. Besides, the proposed method is adaptive to various existing GCN-based models without significantly complicating their optimization process. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can achieve better performance compared with the state-of-the-art models.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3084195","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1600704); Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau, SAR(grant numbers:FDCT/0068/2020/AGJ,FDCT/0045/2019/A1); Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B111103001); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2001207,61872248,61902249,61876065); Guangdong “Pearl River Talent Recruitment Program”(grant numbers:2019ZT08X603); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9451538","Adversarial learning;graph neural network;inductive learning;negative sampling (NS);network embedding","Generators;Adaptation models;Adversarial machine learning;Computer science;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic","data mining;data visualisation;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","adversarial caching training;adversarial training method;conducting unsupervised learning;data mining research;data visualization;existing GCN-based models;graph convolutional network-based models;graph structures;high-quality negative samples;inferior representations;large-scale graphs;learned representations;link prediction;low-dimensional space;negative sampling;negative vertices;network embedding;real-world applications;subsequent machine learning tasks;target vertex;training costs;unrelated negative samples;unsupervised inductive network representation learning;unsupervised inductive NRL;updating strategies;vertex classification;vertex proximity","","4","","32","IEEE","10 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although there have been numerous techniques proposed to optimize the virtual network allocation in data center, the research on coordinating them in a flexible and effective way to autonomically adapt to the workloads for service time reduction is few and far between. To address these issues, in this article we propose Sova, an autonomic framework that can combine the virtual dynamic SR-IOV (DSR-IOV) and the virtual machine live migration (VLM) for virtual network allocations in data centers. DSR-IOV is a SR-IOV-based virtual network allocation technology, but its operation scope is very limited to a single physical machine, which could lead to the local hotspot issue in the course of computation and communication, likely increasing the service response time. In contrast, VLM is an often-used virtualization technique to optimize global network traffic via VM migration. Sova exploits the software-defined approach to combine these two technologies with reducing the service response time as a goal. To realize the autonomic coordination, the architecture of Sova is designed based on the MAPE-K loop in autonomic computing. With this design, Sova can adaptively optimize the network allocation between different services by coordinating DSR-IOV and VLM in autonomic way, depending on the resource usages of physical servers and the network characteristics of VMs. To this end, Sova needs to monitor the network traffic as well as the workload characteristics in the cluster, whereby the network properties are derived on the fly to direct the coordination between these two technologies. Our experiments show that Sova can exploit the advantages of both techniques to match and even beat the better performance of each individual technology by adapting to the VM workload changes.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2020.3012146","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1004804); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672513); Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2019B010137002); Shenzhen Oversea High-Caliber Personnel Innovation Funds(grant numbers:KQCX20170331161854); Shenzhen Basic Research Program(grant numbers:JCYJ20170818153016513); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151358","Virtual machine migration;dynamic SR-IOV;software-defined approach;autonomic computing;MAPE-K loop;network allocation","Resource management;Bandwidth;Data centers;Servers;Virtualization;Time factors;Quality of service","computer centres;software defined networking;virtual machines;virtualisation","SR-IOV-based virtual network allocation technology;service response time;virtualization technique;global network traffic;Sova;autonomic coordination;network properties;software-defined autonomic framework;network virtualization;diverse service-oriented applications;time-bounded service response;data-center networks;service time reduction;virtual dynamic SR-IOV;DSR-IOV;data center;virtual machine live migration","","4","","54","IEEE","28 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed 16 × 10 $\text{Gbps}$ wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) based FSO link uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and digital signal processing (DSP) module to mitigate channel-induced limitations. Additionally, the proposed FSO design also employs Erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) with optimized gain characteristics. Using the data sourced from the Meteorological Department of India, the link analysis reveals that due to weak fog events in coastal areas effective link range of up to 10.75 $\text{km}$ can be achieved while maintaining bit error rate of $10^{-9}$. Despite dominant foggy conditions in hilly, plains and desert areas, the proposed FSO link significantly limits the degrading effects of channel.

Due to multilevel and multimode features, several fundamental issues are required to be settled, such as a dead zone between buck mode and boost mode, capacitor voltage unbalance on both sides, and subharmonics at the edge of modes. For dead zone and capacitor voltage balance problems, a systematic control strategy is proposed, and four kinds of smooth transition technologies are proposed to deal with different cases. Furthermore, to avoid the chattering and subharmonics at the edge of modes, a modified hysteretic transition method is proposed.

Although the challenges can be greatly relaxed by properly designing a compensation network with load-independent output characteristics, the desirable characteristics rendered by fixed compensation networks will be lost and cannot be fully restored by existing control methods once the designed compensation is deviated from the nominal coupling condition. In this article, a dynamic series/series–parallel compensation network, which originally aims to deliver constant output voltage only, is further investigated as a feasible topology for CC–CV battery charger adaptive to different sizes of air gap/misalignment of the coils. As benefited from the extra controllability offered by the parallel compensation capacitance as compared to the series/series compensation counterpart, this article provides alternative design criterion for the effective parallel compensation capacitance for designing and maintaining desirable charging currents in the CC stage while maximizing the efficiency in the CV stage under varying coupling condition.

This paper proposes a novel convex combined heat, and power dispatch model based on model simplification, and constraint relaxations, which improves solution quality, and avoids assumptions on operating regimes of district heating systems. To alleviate mathematical complexity introduced by the commonly used node method, a simplified thermal dynamic model is proposed to capture temperature changes in networked pipelines. Quadratic, and polyhedral relaxations are then applied to convexify the original problem with quadratic equality, and bilinear constraints. Furthermore, an adaptive solution algorithm is developed to successively reduce the relaxation area based on sequential bound tightening, which improves solution optimality with desirable computational efficiency.

This paper proposes a game-theoretic DSM that can optimize the global power consumption schedule by individual TCL user's optimization. By integrating the prediction of REN outputs into the pricing mechanism, the proposed DSM can guide the users to make their best power consumption schedules along with intermittent REN generations, thus to smooth the tie-line power of microgrids. In this paper, a novel pricing mechanism is firstly developed based on the concave N-person game theory, which is more adaptive and flexible compared with existing game-theoretic DSM. Then, an individual's power consumption optimization and its simplified model are developed considering the constraints of the TCL model and personal preferences. The simplified model can be easily solved and achieve a fast solution in the power consumption game. An implementation framework of the proposed DSM is further developed for practical application.

Any global information, including the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, is unavailable in the control scheme development. The reference trajectory is designed for each agent, and the corresponding performance function, which reflects the off-track error evolution and control cost, is proposed. The sufficient condition for the synchronization of reference trajectories, which does not rely on the topology dwell time, is established by constructing an appropriate current topology-independent Lyapunov function. Due to the fact that the nonlinear function in the system dynamical equation of each agent is unknown, an equation termed integral reinforcement learning (IRL) equation is provided, and it is strictly proven that the provided IRL equation is equivalent to the given Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. The model-free optimal feedback control law is then derived based on the IRL technique. In the implementation of the developed control scheme, the neural network approximation tool is adopted, and the scheme is applied to a numerical system to show its effectiveness.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2022.3203979","Macau Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:SKL-IOTSC-2021-2023,0072/2020/AMJ,077/2018/A2,0060/2019/A1); Research Committee at University of Macau(grant numbers:MYRG2018-00029-FST,MYRG2019-00023-FST); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971476,61873128); UM Macao Talent Programme(grant numbers:UMMTP-2020-01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9899360","Fully distributed consensus;multiagent systems;nonlinear systems;reinforcement learning;switching topologies","Multi-agent systems;Trajectory;Topology;Switches;Mathematical models;Lyapunov methods;Laplace equations","adaptive control;control system synthesis;distributed control;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feedback;Lyapunov methods;matrix algebra;multi-agent systems;nonlinear control systems;optimal control;optimisation;reinforcement learning","control cost;control scheme development;current topology-independent Lyapunov function;distributed optimal consensus;global information;Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation;integral reinforcement learning equation;IRL equation;Laplacian matrix;leaderless multiagent systems;model-free optimal feedback control law;neural network approximation tool;nonlinear function;numerical system;off-track error evolution;performance function;reference trajectory;second-order nonlinear multiagent systems;second-order nonlinear system;sufficient condition;switching topologies;system dynamical equation","","","","52","IEEE","21 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Cloud-assisted mobile edge computing provides malleable resources but introduces considerable overhead. Due to the geographical distributions and distances of the edge, cloud, and mobile terminal, promoting cost efficiency and reducing the makespan of applications are urgent targets. For multiple mobile applications, the soft deadline constraint for each application is common in the edge-cloud environment. When multiple users initiate application requests, scheduling on the target offloaded platform commences. Some workflows, especially newly arrived workflows, might suffer from “starving to death,” which has the risk of being missed. This article describes a dynamic, multiworkflow offloading, and scheduling, adaptive heterogeneous earliest-finish-time-based algorithm, which can lightly run on a distributed network. We explore an innovative model composed of a multiobjective makespan and cost for a soft deadline constraint optimization problem.

This paper puts forth a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based link adaptation (LA) technique, referred to as deep reinforcement learning link adaptation (DRLLA), to select efficient modulation and coding scheme (MCS) in the presence of the outdated CQI feedback. The goal of DRLLA is to maximize the link throughput while achieving a low block error rate (BLER). We first give explicit definitions of state, action, and reward in DRL paradigms, thereby realizing DRLLA. Then, to trade off the throughput against the BLER, we further develop a new experience replay mechanism called classified experience replay (CER) as the underpinning technique in DRLLA. In CER, experiences are separated into two buckets, one for successful experiences and the other for failed experiences, and then a fixed proportion from each is sampled to replay. The essence of CER is to obtain different trade-offs via adjusting the proportion among different training experiences. Furthermore, to reduce the signaling overhead and the system reconfiguration cost caused by frequent MCS switching, we propose a new action selection strategy termed as switching-controlled $\epsilon$-greedy (SC-$\epsilon$-greedy) for DRLLA. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art OLLA, LTSLA, and DRLLA with other experience replay mechanisms, DRLLA with CER can achieve higher throughput and lower BLER in various time-varying scenarios, and be more robust to different CQI feedback delays and CQI reporting periods. Furthermore, with the SC-$\epsilon$-greedy policy, DRLLA can capture better trade-offs between the link transmission quality and the MCS switching overhead compared with other baselines.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2023.3236791","Open Research Project Programme of the State Key Laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City; Universidade de Macau(grant numbers:SKL-IoTSC(UM)-2021-2023/ORP/GA03/2022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024770","Link adaptation;deep reinforcement learning;channel quality indicator;modulation and coding scheme","Switches;Throughput;Indexes;Reinforcement learning;Costs;Signal to noise ratio;Long Term Evolution","deep learning (artificial intelligence);error statistics;feedback;Long Term Evolution;reinforcement learning;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","BLER;CER;classified experience replay;CQI feedback delays;deep reinforcement learning link adaptation;DRL-based LA technique;DRLLA;experience replay mechanism;link adaptation technique;link transmission quality;long term evolution;low block error rate;LTE systems;modulation and coding scheme;new radio systems;NR systems;outdated channel quality indicator feedback;outdated CQI feedback;system reconfiguration cost","","","","43","IEEE","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional flooding searching algorithms (e.g., OLSR, AODV) lead to huge communication overheads, while greedy searching algorithms (e.g., Geolocation-Based Routing protocol) pose low routing efficiency.

To this end, we first study three special cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming, namely user-adaptive IRS beamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming, by characterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the latter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of IRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required for UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization framework for dynamic IRS beamforming, which is applicable for any given number of IRS phase-shift vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the general problem with highly coupled optimization variables, we propose two algorithms to solve it and particularly, the low-complexity algorithm exploits the intrinsic structure of the optimal solution as well as the solutions to the cases with user-adaptive and static IRS beamforming.

Therefore, PHY modeling is required which is time-intensive and requires highly complex computations. For this purpose, the PHY performance is usually abstracted in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), also known as physical layer abstraction (PLA). However, due to fading, the symbols inside a packet could have different SINRs which require effective SINR mapping to compute an equivalent SINR. In the context of multi-connectivity, the received SINR depends on all connected links where each link experiences independent fading and on the used link combining technique. As a result, the computation of effective SINR also depends on the combining technique and fading experienced by individual links. To model PHY performance by considering all these effects, we develop PLA for multi-connectivity communications. This includes the computation of received symbols SINR for various link combining techniques and mapping them to effective SINR using enhanced exponential effective SINR mapping (eEESM). Furthermore, a new optimization method is introduced for eEESM to reduce its optimization complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed PLA accurately estimate the performance of different order of multi-connectivity communications under various fading conditions.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2021.3106771","projects “5G Lab Germany Forschungsfeld Lausitz”(grant numbers:VB5GFLAUS); funded by the Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure (BMVI), Germany, and the “Industrial Radio Lab Germany”(grant numbers:16KIS1010K); Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9525058","Physical layer abstraction;multi-connectivity;physical layer;diversity combining schemes;link adaptation;URLLC;5G NR","Signal to noise ratio;Interference;Diversity reception;Programmable logic arrays;Fading channels;Reliability;Wireless communication","error statistics;fading channels;MIMO communication;OFDM modulation;optimisation;radio links;radio receivers","physical layer abstraction;multiconnectivity communications;low-latency communications;use cases system-level studies;PHY modeling;highly complex computations;PHY performance;signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio;PLA;fading;equivalent SINR;received SINR;connected links;link combining technique;received symbols SINR;enhanced exponential effective SINR mapping","","3","","33","IEEE","30 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many existing FL algorithms over wireless networks adopting synchronous model aggregation suffer from the straggler issue, due to the heterogeneity of local computing power and channel conditions. To address this issue, we in this paper advocate an asynchronous FL framework with adaptive client selection for training latency minimization, taking into account the client availability and long-term fairness. We consider a practical scenario, where the channel conditions and the locally available computing power are not known in prior. This makes the client selection problem challenging, as the training latency consists of the uplink/downlink transmission time and the local training time. To this end, we tackle the asynchronous client selection problem in an online manner by converting the latency minimization problem into a multi-armed bandit problem, and leverage the upper confidence bound policy and virtual queue technique in Lyapunov optimization to solve the problem. We theoretically show that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret performance, ensures long-term fairness, and guarantees training convergence. Results show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the training time by up to 50% when compared to the baseline algorithms.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2022.3211998","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:U20A20159,62001294); National Development and Reform Commission of China (NDRC) through “5G Network Enabled Intelligent Medicine and Emergency Rescue System for Giant Cities.”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9916164","Asynchronous federated learning;multi-armed bandit;client selection","Training;Computational modeling;Servers;Wireless communication;Wireless networks;Convergence;Adaptation models","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-armed bandit problems;telecommunication computing;telecommunication scheduling","adaptive client selection;asynchronous client selection problem;asynchronous federated learning;asynchronous FL framework;client availability;downlink transmission time;latency minimization problem;Lyapunov optimization;multiarmed bandit problem;online client selection;synchronous model aggregation;uplink transmission time;upper confidence bound policy;virtual queue technique;wireless networks","","1","","43","IEEE","11 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Depending on the availability of the eavesdropping channel state information (CSI), both the full CSI and statistical CSI of the eavesdropper are considered. For the full eavesdropping CSI scenario, we adopt the adaptive-rate wiretap code scheme with the aim of maximizing minimum secrecy capacity subject to the successive interference cancellation decoding order constraints. To proceed, we propose an alternating hybrid beamforming (AHB) algorithm to jointly optimize the receive beamforming, transmit power, and reflection/transmission coefficients. While for the statistical eavesdropping CSI scenario, the constant-rate wiretap code scheme is employed to minimize the maximum secrecy outage probability (SOP) subject to the quality-of-service requirements of legitimate users. Then, we derive the exact SOP expression under the constant-rate coding strategy and develop an extended AHB algorithm for the joint secrecy beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Moreover, some useful guidance about the quantification of phase shift/amplitude and the deployment of STAR-RIS is provided.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2022.3190563","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971320); Natural Science Basic Research Plan of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2021JQ-206); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020A1515110084); Macau Science and Technology Development Fund (FDCT)(grant numbers:0119/2020/A3); State key laboratory of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau-2021-2023; Guangdong-Macau Joint Laboratory for Advanced and Intelligent Computing(grant numbers:2020B1212030003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9834288","Non-orthogonal multiple access;physical layer security;STAR-RIS;secrecy beamforming design","NOMA;Eavesdropping;Wireless communication;Array signal processing;Communication system security;Uplink;Optimization","array signal processing;decoding;interference suppression;nonorthogonal multiple access;probability;quality of service;radio networks;radiofrequency interference;radiowave propagation;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication security","adaptive-rate wiretap code scheme;base station;confidential signals;constant-rate coding strategy;constant-rate wiretap code scheme;eavesdropping channel state information;electromagnetic propagation environment;exact SOP expression;extended AHB algorithm;joint secrecy beamforming design;maximum secrecy outage probability;minimum secrecy capacity;phase shift;quality-of-service requirements;reflection-transmission coefficients;secure transmission;simultaneously transmitting reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface;STAR-RIS assisted uplink NOMA networks;statistical CSI;statistical eavesdropping CSI scenario;successive interference cancellation decoding order constraints;transmit power;uplink nonorthogonal multiple access system","","12","","44","IEEE","20 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
