An adaptive policy-driven middleware for mobile computing,2017,"The recent trend in mobile computing has led to complex environments, and requirements which are changed dynamically. Adaptation is a solution for complex, and flexible mobile computing systems, it can not only dynamically adapt to a variety of changes inside of the physical layer, but also adapt to changes outside of their applications, and requirements. In this paper, we present an adaptive middleware system, which can dynamically relocate software components between computers to provide adaptation. On top of it, we also design a policy interpreter to execute user-defined adaptation to control the location of program at Runtime. This paper describes the two ideas with several scenarios, such as location measurement, and preference recommendation components in a sensor network. In the last, we demonstrate several sets of round-trip time through the proposed middleware system, and policies on Google Cloud Platform, which are verified in three instance groups at different zones.",10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397632
Data-centric framework for adaptive smart city honeynets,2017,"A smart city system will contain diverse heterogeneous smart objects. Their complexity will range from simple reduced function devices (RFD) acting as common nodes, to full function devices (FFD) acting as coordinators and controlling actuators. As part of the Internet of Things, web facing devices can be remotely accessed for monitoring, control and data exchange. This makes them vulnerable to cyber attacks and compromise. To analyse such attacks, honeynets and honeypots are deployed to attract attackers and capture their activity for behavioural analysis. Designing honeynets is difficult due to the broad engineering scope of smart cities as a concept, and consequent diversity of smart object characteristics such as communication channels, interaction, data exchange and embedded security. This paper brings order to this diversity and scope by taking a data-centric view of smart city devices. The data-centric view assesses smart devices for their criticality, security and complexity. It presents a framework using this view, for adaptive honeynet development. It then validates the new framework by categorizing smart objects using the data centric view and applying them to the framework.",10.1109/SCSP.2017.7973836
Self-adaptive cyber city system,2016,"The trend in using information and communication technology as an engine of the current city management system has hypnotized various cities in the world, including Indonesia. Many terms appeared such as cyber city, smart city, intelligent city, or whatever it's called with the various developments of concepts that offer a wide range of sophistication and ease in managing any city needs. But behind the greatness of the proposed system, whether they are aware of how the characteristics of a city should be. In a city, there are so many diversities of the dynamic elements that make us must have an adaptive system to control it. This paper proposes an approach that has concern for the importance of adaptability to help the city management system. Two type of problems that become the main focus that make why the self-adaptive capability is important are deterministic and non-deterministic problems. The developed key strategy consists of two approaches. First, through series of modification for representing new problem space for solving a deterministic problem. Second, a non-deterministic problem is handled by a system that prepared automatically to search solution. The main objective of this paper is to depict a model to handle both types, through cyber city case illustration.",10.1109/ICAICTA.2016.7803142
Smart city concept as socio-technical system,2017,"Smart City is a very popular concept as the advancement in technology bring new possibilities how to make life in cities easier and more comfortable. Whereas the technical part of Smart City concept is highly discussed in research articles, impact on social part of this system is not in the center of interest. This article aims to contribute to the complex view of this concept. First we discuss different concepts close to Smart City and based on literature review to evaluate involvement into technical or social research areas. Then we use Leavitt's model adapted for Smart Cities to discuss all interconnected elements. Last part describe plans for Pardubice Smart City in the view of Leavitt's model.",10.1109/DT.2017.8024297
SCCIR: Smart Cities Critical Infrastructure Response Framework,2011,"Critical infrastructures play important roles in ensuring the wellbeing of the populace. Protecting critical infrastructures and ensuring their continued operation will be an important part of future Smart City ecosystems. Minimising the destruction of failing critical infrastructure components or system components that are geographically close critical services is essential. Equally important are the system of systems relationships that a failing system has, as these could render a minor system critical under certain circumstances. Infrastructure failure is usually brought under control through system adaptation e.g. using sensor area networks to close valves or by emergency response e.g. extinguishing fires. Current response procedures rely on antiquated information sharing techniques and provide little or no opportunity to effect change within the failing infrastructures systems. There may also be minimal understanding of the important systems of systems role that is being provided by components of the failing system. This paper details our initial work on the Smart Cities Critical Infrastructure response framework. The goal of our framework is to provide a response strategy to first responders based on smart cities information flows. Where these information flows have been compromised we propose a robust infrastructure state preservation system as to provide an interface to a failing critical infrastructure.",10.1109/DeSE.2011.112
DingNet: A Self-Adaptive Internet-of-Things Exemplar,2019,"Recent efforts have shown that research on self-adaptive systems can benefit from exemplars to evaluate and compare new methods, techniques and tools. One highly relevant application domain for self-adaptation is the Internet-of-Things (IoT). While some initial exemplars have been proposed for IoT, these exemplars are limited in scope to support research in realistic IoT domains, such as smart cities. To address this limitation, we introduce the DingNet exemplar, a reference implementation for research on self-adaptation in the domain of IoT. DingNet offers a simulator that maps directly to a physical IoT system that is deployed in the area of Leuven, Belgium. DingNet models a set of geographically distributed gateways, which are connected to a user application that is deployed at a front-end server. The gateways can interact over a LoRaWAN network with local stationary and mobile motes that can be equipped with sensors and actuators. The exemplar comes with a set of scenarios for comparing the effectiveness of different self-adaptive solutions. We illustrate how the exemplar is used for a typical adaptation problem of smart city IoT application, where mobile motes dynamically have to adapt their communication settings to ensure reliable and energy efficient communication.",10.1109/SEAMS.2019.00033
A Design Framework for Smart City Learning Scenarios,2013,"In this paper we present a design Framework for Smart City Learning scenarios based on three main aspects Learner, Contextualized Activity and Space. The strengths of our Design framework lie in the fact that, in a formal manner through friendly graphical interfaces, it allows pedagogical designers and teachers:(1) to specify, model, generate and simulate different types of context-aware and adaptive learning activities (e-learning, M-learning and P-learning) and their related contexts. (2) to design indoor and outdoor spaces within smart cities to enable pupils or students to learn through factual cases and to experiment various learning scenarios.(3) To model and simulate interactions and co-adaptivity rules between Learner, Contextualized Activity and Space.",10.1109/IE.2013.34
Capability Adaptive Elastic IoT Architecture,2015,"IoT networks, together with the data that flows between inter-networked smart devices are growing at unprecedented rates. Storing the data arriving in high volume at IoT gateways or transferring it to back-end clusters for timely processing and real-time response generation is not always feasible, and generally requires considerable overprovisioning of resources. In typical configurations, a computationally capable front-end gateway is available for coordinating the operation of smart devices and for linking them to computation and communication rich back-end infrastructure. It is attractive to harness the computational capabilities in front-end gateways to achieve elasticity of deployment so that the total throughput and response time of IoT solutions can be optimized by intelligent division of labor between devices, front-end gateways, and back-end servers. This paper proposes an Elastic Computing Framework (ECF), an architecture in which programmability of front-end machines is drawn upon to dynamically divide data processing tasks into those that see all of the data but perform simple operations on it, and those that see a transformed subset of the data and extract deep insights from it. This results in lifting the pressure on the network that links the front-and back-ends, and achieves capability adaptive deployment of IoT solutions. In experimental evaluation with one production usage scenario, this approach achieves between six fold and fifty fold reduction in data transferred to back-end clusters, and improves responsiveness by roughly sixteen fold.",10.1109/SmartCity.2015.138
Smart government assessment using Scottish Smart City Maturity Model: A case study of Depok city,2017,"Nowadays, many cities around the world are moving towards the smart city by advancing the utilization of ICT and Depok is one of them. The Scottish Smart City Maturity Model, a smart city framework adapted from the IDC model and British Standard Institution PAS 181, can be used as a reference in determining the concept and direction of a smart city implementation. It identifies and measures the existing condition of a city in order to map the city's capabilities. Smart government, as a blend of technology and innovation, can be described as the next step for e-government. It is identified a vital part of the transformation towards smart city. Hence, this study aims to assess the maturity of the smart government in Depok City. This study adopts the Scottish Smart City Maturity Model using a qualitative approach that includes interviews, observations, and document analysis. This study also performs weigh calculation to determine the importance of the smart government dimension using the Entropy method. The results show that Depok is at level 1 (Ad-hoc) indicating that the city is still focusing on the development and application of ICT and on improving the use of data in its services.",10.1109/ICACSIS.2017.8355018
An Adaptive Park Bench System to Enhance Availability of Appropriate Seats for the Elderly: A Safety Engineering Approach for Smart City,2019,"An important part of older adults' social integration is their involvement in urban life outdoors. While going outdoors contributes to participation and well-being, older adults often avoid to go outdoors because of deteriorating health and individual perceptions of threats to their safe mobility. A particular perceived threat to safety and a crucial barrier to go outdoors is the perception of lacking appropriate seating possibilities. To mitigate this barrier, we introduce an adaptive park bench system as an innovative form of smart urban objects. The system of adaptive park benches seeks to ensure that each pedestrian has available an appropriate seat when necessary. Empty adaptive park benches are particularly appropriate due to an active assistance functionality for sitting down and standing up. We developed an AI based algorithm and validated its effectiveness by conducting a simulation of a use case scenario created with domain experts.",10.1109/CBI.2019.00049
A model for adaptive accessibility of everyday objects in smart cities,2016,"This paper proposes a model that exploits the Internet of Things in the urban environment to promote the accessibility to physical real-world objects especially to those with special needs. The approach is primarily based on connecting and sharing data about accessibility requirements and real-world environment data. The approach is also founded on annotating physical objects, and adapting the interaction with the virtual side of cyber-physical objects in order to make physical objects accessible in a smart environment via smart devices. We define and build our model as an extension of previous research results in order to facilitate interaction with everyday objects and promote quality of life for those with special needs.",10.1109/PIMRC.2016.7794583
A spectrum-based adaptive sampling algorithm for smart sensing,2017,The ever-increasing diffusion of smart pervasive systems has brought to attention the need to optimally manage available energy as well as the request for more general intelligent functionalities. In this direction the paper presents a novel spectrum-based change detection test (CDT) designed to be executed on low-power embedded devices. By exploiting the energy-based features extracted from spectral sub-bands the CDT detects changes in time variance in the incoming signal (reactions to the change might follow) as well as disambiguates between changes and aliasing phenomena. When aliasing is detected an adaptation mechanism is activated to adapt the sampling frequency to the real needs of the signal under inspection (so as to reduce energy consumption). This algorithm enhances the state-of-the-art of adaptive sampling by offering an efficient alternative to complete spectral investigation. The effectiveness of the proposed solution has been assessed on synthetic and real datasets.,10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397444
A Crowd-Sourced Adaptive Safe Navigation for Smart Cities,2017,"There has been a lot of work on finding safest path from source to destination. However, all these works mainly rely on the crime data available through government sources. The works are missing many important factor that affect safety of a route. In this work, we first propose safety measurement score and then show how it can be used for safe navigation. We proposed a comprehensive safety measure that adapts with time according to the user feedback and online crowd-sourced information. We have developed a complete end-to-end system to demonstrate efficacy of the proposed framework.",10.1109/ISM.2017.77
iQAS: An integration platform for QoI assessment as a service for smart cities,2016,"While reducing costs and improving sustainability, a common goal for Smart Cities is to become more “liveable” for their citizens. By taking advantage of new information sources offered by the Internet of Things (IoT), cities can rely on sensing platforms to improve their service offer. These sensing platforms, however, raise new research challenges, in particular regarding Quality of Information (QoI). To cope with this issue, common platforms generally provide quality-oriented internal mechanisms. Nevertheless, the configuration of such platforms is complex, especially for Smart City stakeholders that may have various skill levels and different areas of expertise. As a result, QoI assessment is often delegated to end applications where developers have to implement their own adaptation mechanisms. This paper proposes and describes iQAS, an integration platform for QoI Assessment as a Service for Smart Cities. iQAS is autonomic, extensible and configurable, allowing Smart City stakeholders to collaboratively assess and improve (when possible) QoI in real-time. While the platform development is at its early stages, we illustrate within a concrete case study the need for QoI assessment and the benefits to implement adaptation mechanisms.",10.1109/WF-IoT.2016.7845400
Self-adaptive and resilient urban networking infrastructure for disasters and smart city services,2017,"When a disaster strikes a city, conventional information networking infrastructure can be damaged or completely lost, leading to suffering or loss of life. These consequences are avoidable with the introduction of an urban networking fabric for emergency services. We describe here an overall design for a Network for Urban Emergency Services (NUES) that provides essential communication services during disasters and post-disaster recovery. The core of NUES is a dense wireless networking fabric composed of low-cost wireless nodes. Because each node is autonomously powered, and NUES takes advantage of satellite networking services, the overall NUES architecture can be independent of all other (conventional) infrastructure, depending only on users' battery-powered devices (such as cell phones or tablets) and satellite data services. But it also has the ability to exploit conventional infrastructure (in particular cellular wireless) to reduce cost and provide greater bandwidth to users. Since some NUES nodes themselves may be damaged or lost, NUES is also designed for resilience, with redundant nodes connected by a self-healing network. Due to its dense coverage and modular node architecture, NUES also provides smart city sensing services the year around, greatly increasing its cost efficiency.",10.1109/BigData.2017.8258424
Data driven reference architecture for smart city ecosystems,2017,"With the convergence of information and telecommunication technologies, the vision of the `Smart City' is fast becoming a reality. City governments in a growing number of countries are capitalizing on these advances to enhance the lives of their citizens and to increase efficiency and sustainability. In this paper, we elaborate on smartCityRA, a reference architecture for Smart City projects, which serves as the design language for creating smart cities blueprints. Such a blueprint caters for diverse stakeholders, devices, platforms, and technologies. We report on our experience in carrying out a proof-of-concept use case with a major telecommunication provider in the UAE. In doing so, we refined our multiple-view model of the initial smartCityRA reference architecture. We show that Data in smart city applications drive the entire development lifecycle and should be considered early in the development cycle. In addition, Data affects all the other views in the smartCityRA and hence the Data View needs to be at the heart of the entire smartCityRA. Realizing the Data view using a component like a Data Hub helped in creating a central integration location for disparate data from different sources, thus reliving developers from dealing with several entities individually. Finally, we show that any smart city reference architecture, like smartCityRA, should be at the right level of abstraction to enable the flexibility of adoption and adaptation by different stakeholders and components.",10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397556
A context model development process for smart city operations,2015,"Systems enabling smart city operations are highly adaptive complex systems that pose great challenges in their development and operation. Current user-driven techniques for system domain modeling and requirements engineering are not adequate for supporting the development of such systems. In this paper, we propose a development process and an environment-driven modeling approach for the Requirement Engineering Context Awareness methodology to be used for smart city applications. To this end, we propose the use of ontologies to build the environment context model. We show that the environment dimension is the most important dimension of context with the highest impact of changes in a dynamic context. We illustrate our approach by presenting an ontology-based context model of I-Parking. We present dynamic models of typical scenarios of interactions. We propose our approach as an important step in developing highly adaptive context-aware systems for smart city operations where uncertainty and changing conditions in the environment need to be carefully modeled and addressed.",10.1109/SOLI.2015.7367605
An adaptive system architecture for devising adaptive user interfaces for mobile ERP apps,2017,"The mobile ERP model can enrich the research on smart city concept with an ICT application that can enhance the sustainability and the quality of business life for enterprises' employees, and economic prosperity for people. Presently, this model has become a core requirement for enterprises that have ERP systems, due to the benefits that can be reaped from it. However, this model suffers from poor usability, due to the usability challenges that are inherited from ERP systems, and the mobile context of use. Adaptive user interfaces (AUIs) were exploited in numerous research works as a means to improve the usability of software applications by addressing their usability challenges through these types of UIs. However, a knowledge gap was identified in finding an appropriate adaptive system architecture that can support the adaptation processes in AUIs for mobile ERP apps. Therefore, this paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting an adaptive system architecture that can enable the automatic adaptation for the UIs' components of mobile ERP apps according to the context of use.",10.1109/IT-DREPS.2017.8277812
A cyber-physical system approach to smart city development,2017,"In the contemporary era, the world is confronting numerous challenges that should be dealt with in the near future like effective management of energy, necessity for economic development, reducing environmental challenges, quality and security of life of its inhabitants. The growing concentration of the global inhabitants into towns and cities puts the urban areas in the center of the concerns and make them vital stakeholders for the viable growth strategy of the world. Consequently, Cyber-physical systems (CPS) can play a significant role in their adaptation to smart cities applications and projects. This paper aims to give an overview of the smart city concept and emerging technologies in this area and a brief explanation of cyber-physical systems. It then highlights the potential role of CPS in the development of smart city applications and includes some actual examples of the adaptation of CPS to smart city projects. The paper then outlines some advantages of the CPS in this context and discusses potential challenges. The paper also offers a research agenda for the future.",10.1109/ICSGSC.2017.8038587
Citizens as sensors: The cognitive city paradigm,2011,"Intelligent/smart cities have been touted as one of the solutions to the challenges of ever increasing complexities faced by present and future urban environments. Leveraging information technology to allow better demand and supply management of key urban infrastructure system offer immense opportunities for efficiency and quality of service improvements in urban services. In this paper, we argue that implementing sensor networks are a necessary but not sufficient approach to improving urban living. Building on the concept of the cognitive city discussed elsewhere by the authors, this paper proposed an architectural process approach that allows city decision-makers and service providers to integrate cognition into urban processes. Cognition is the ability of a system to learn from previous experiences and adapt its behavior based on them. A cognitive system is able to sense, perceive and respond to changes in the environment and can therefore improve a system's performance by increasing its adaptive capacity.",10.1109/CEWIT.2011.6135861
An adaptive I-Parking application: An ontology-based approach,2016,"Complex adaptive systems are in the heart of smart city operations. Developing such systems is very challenging. Current user-driven techniques for modeling the system domain are not sufficient for supporting the development of such systems. Additionally, in the majority of cases, existing work focused on user interface adaptation without considering content personalization. In this paper, we propose the use of ontologies for dealing with the adaptation issue, while taking into consideration both content and container of the interface. To this end, we extend the model that was proposed in our previous work, and that focused only on modeling the “Environment” dimension, by adding three other dimensions, namely, “Devices”, “Users”, and “Services” (EDUS). We validate our proposal on an I-Parking smart phone application that offers personalized and context-aware information to the users.",10.1109/FTC.2016.7821692
Knowledge lifecycle and smart cities learning position paper for DUBAI 2020: Smart city learning,2014,"This paper is mainly concerned with the strong relation between knowledge Society and Smart Cities. KS allows SC to deploy and materialize all its potentialities and to take advantage of all its resources for the benefit of citizens; adversely, SC offers live, advanced, first-quality knowledge resources, whilst KS ensures optimal, also unexpected, semantic retrieval and connection of existing resources. In this context, Learning has a key-role with respect to the full engagement of final users, in the double role of Citizens and qualified Human Capital for Competitiveness [1]. From the technological point of view, our approach is based on Adaptive, Knowledge-based Learning Systems, a Personal Learning and Working Environment and a general Semantic Framework. Distinctive features like Discovery of Linked Semantic Resources and Semantic Paths and Natural Language - based Semantic Retrieval and Interaction, based on Systems and tools above, are shortly presented.",10.1109/ICWOAL.2014.7009227
A smart city adaptive lighting system,2018,"This paper presents an urban smart lighting system capable to autonomously control the street lamp lighting level by exploiting data related to vehicles (bus, car, motorcycle and bike) and/or pedestrians traffic in a specific area. The system is able to set the lighting level on the basis of required needs and allows one to reduce energy costs. To this end, it makes use of local controllers, motion sensors, video-camera and electronic devices for video processing. In this way the inputs coming from the sensors is processed in order to optimally dim the lighting by applying an 1-10 V control input voltage to the fixture or driver. The control can be performed either on a decentralized fashion on each single street lamp or on a group of them. Experimental results show that with respect to a traditional street lamp system, the presented architecture allows energy saving up to 65%.",10.1109/FMEC.2018.8364076
A data lifeCycle model for smart cities,2016,"Smart Cities are the most challenging and promising technological solutions for absorbing the increasing pressure of population growth, while simultaneously enforcing a sustainable economic progress as well as a higher quality of life. Several technologies are involved in a potential Smart City deployment, although data are the fuel to achieve the demanded and mandatory smartness. Data can be obtained from multiple sources, in large quantities, and with a variety of formats, therefore, an appropriate management is critical for their effective usage. Data life cycle models constitute an effective trend towards developing an integral and efficient data management framework, from data creation to data consumption and removal. In this paper we present the Smart City Comprehensive Data LifeCycle (SCC-DLC) model, a data management architecture generated from a comprehensive scenario agnostic model, tailored for the particular scenario of Smart Cities. We define the management of each data life phase, and describe its implementation on a Smart City with Fog-to-Cloud (F2C) resources management, an architecture that combines the advantages of both cloud and fog strategies.",10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763506
Adaptive filtering as a service for smart city applications,2017,"Smart cities are a key factor in the consumption of materials and resources. As populations grow and resources become scarcer, the efficient usage of these limited goods becomes more important. Building on and integrating with a huge amount of data, the cities of the future are becoming a realization today. There are millions of sensors in place already, monitoring various things in metropolises. In the near future, these sensors will multiply until they can monitor everything from streetlights and trashcans to road conditions and energy consumption. In this context, effective strategies or solutions for refining data sets can play a key role. Based on these premises, we propose intelligent and adaptive filtering mechanisms as a service (FIlAAS) integrated in the VITAL-OS middleware and will show their feasibility and their effectiveness in the smart city context.",10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000147
Traffic Flow Simulation Based on Adaptive Agent,2018,"This paper describes the driver's vehicle behavior as the response of an intelligent body according to the environment and situation, and describes the characteristics of macro-traffic flow through the response of each independent intelligent body, providing a basis for intelligent driving and intelligent control. First, the adaptability description is carried out with the behavior of single-lane vehicles. Three driving states are defined and their driving behaviors and decision-making rules are analyzed based on the driver's expectation objectives. The simulation is realized by using the mathematical description the Boid model method of Couzin et al.[6][7][8]. The simulation results show that the behavior change of the individual adaptive driving vehicle is completely consistent with the characteristics of the macro-traffic flow, and the cooperative characteristics of the group intelligence are presented. Individual driving vehicles show good adaptability and self-drive to the change of environment and current traffic condition. The change of individual driving behavior of the vehicle will have an impact on the adjacent local vehicle individuals. The change of traffic density affects the speed of traffic flow. Bad driving behavior will affect the speed of local or even the whole traffic flow on the road, which will lead to the closing and splitting of the vehicle queue. In serious cases, the vehicle queue will stop and stop, leading to the decrease of the road capacity.",10.1109/ICSCSE.2018.00150
A Smart City Application Modeling Framework: A Case Study on Re-engineering a Smart Retail Platform,2018,"Smart City Application Engineering is a challenging task due to the constantly evolving environment in which these applications operate and the variability of the different types of technologies that synthesize them. Therefore, flexibility and extendibility are two important quality attributes that should be taken into consideration when designing Smart City Applications. In this paper, we propose the Smart City Application Modeling Framework (SCAMF) for analyzing and designing Smart City applications that is based on the concept of Clean Architecture and adopts the representation formalism of feature models. SCAMF methodology is evaluated through a case study on a Smart Retail Platform. Quality indices like flexibility, extendibility along with metrics as complexity, cohesion and design size are compared to the initial version of the application that was completely re-engineered due to maintenance problems. The results of the study suggest that the proposed methodology improves quality indices like flexibility and extendibility up to 120%.",10.1109/SEAA.2018.00027
A framework for transforming Dubai into a smart city,2017,"Smart City is a solution to the increased globalization of cities by managing and applying ICT to all the aspects of the city such as mobility, electricity, water, energy, economy, environment, governance, health, and education to increase the quality of life for city dwellers and the future sustainability. As people started to move from rural areas into cities, cities started to have congestion, traffic, crimes, increased carbon emissions, illiteracy, and unemployment. Cities have to manage these complexities by finding smart solutions. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has launched the strategy to transform Dubai into a smart city and to be ready for expo 2020 that could result in road traffic and increased tourism. Other reasons for Dubai to become a smart city are that are the business and real estate boom, because foreign investments are pouring in and many populations are coming to Dubai, so it needs to have sustainability. Dubai is in a state where it requires having sustainable energies and buildings to accept many populations. A framework is a set of principles and guidelines to prepare the right components and people, and taking the right steps and stages to achieve the outcomes. A roadmap is a vision done by stakeholders, of the final outcome of the desired project, and it takes from 10 to 50 years. A roadmap is a plan or strategy intended to achieve a particular goal. This research has studied various smart city initiatives in the world and the numerous frameworks on smart cities. An adaptive framework specifically for Dubai City has been proposed and a roadmap for its implementation has been suggested. This outcome can be used by the Government of Dubai to plan their smart city strategies.",10.1109/CTIT.2017.8259573
The Model of the Queuing System with Adaptive Traffic,2017,This paper presents a model of a queueing system with multi-service adaptive traffic. This type of low-latency traffic is one of the most dominant type of traffic in modern packet networks.

Using Public Private Partnership models in smart cities - proposal for Croatia,2017,"How smart is a “smart city”? According to Asian examples of newly growing smart cities, usage of technology can improve life standard and reduce cost of living, improve operational efficiency, environmental sustainability, eco-friendly infrastructure, smart technology Internet of Things (IoT), smart living and direct citizen participation in decision making process. Learning, adaptation and innovation could be the future for Croatian cities by using all mentioned, which will improve social, regulatory and safety indicators for designing a better living environment for Croatian citizens. While using Public Private Partnership (PPP) models, crowdsourcing and democratic ecologies which provide better and more efficient public services by taking advantage of private sector's “know-how”, cities will create long-term investment opportunities and sustain real time optimization strategies by providing safe and reliable place to invest. The intention of this paper is to show how the (local) government's role in PPP projects is to evaluate and approve detailed execution plans of the concessionaire while the private partner's role is to design, build, finance, and operate the facilities. In futuro, digital technologies offer numerous possibilities for citizen participation in decision making at local and regional government level.",10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973643
A Simple and Efficient Link Adaptation Method for Narrowband Internet of Things,2019,"This paper proposes a simple and efficient link adaptation method for Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IOT). The proposed method will perform link adaptation from two dimensions. First, the combination of the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) level and the resource unit (RU) number can select a larger transport block according to the packet size compared with the straightforward method. That will reduce the number of narrowband physical uplink shared channel (NPUSCH) and narrowband physical downlink control channel (NPDCCH) transmissions. Besides, the selected repetitions number will satisfy the requirements of the block error rate (BLER) according to the channel status. The results show that the power consumption could be decreased about 27% and spectral efficiency could be improved about 69% compared with the straightforward method.",10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00365
A meta-model for including social behavior and data into smart city management simulations,2015,"Smart city management can be regarded to bridge different realms of thinking about cities, i.e. 1) the city as complex-adaptive system, 2) socio-technical operational control center and 3) multi-actor policy-making. Underpinned by different world views and theoretical bodies, integration of the three realms puts forward new demands on simulation approaches and challenges current knowledge and available technology regarding integration of sub-models across different systems. In order to support urban transportation management, a holistic approach is needed that semantically connects the three realms by incorporation of human behavior and knowledge. Combining research on knowledge management and computer science, this paper presents a novel meta-framework as socio-technical hybrid simulation language to generalize integration of simulations, gaming and data for modeling urban transportation.",10.1109/WSC.2015.7408289
