Presently, this model has become a core requirement for enterprises that have ERP systems, due to the benefits that can be reaped from it. However, this model suffers from poor usability, due to the usability challenges that are inherited from ERP systems, and the mobile context of use. Adaptive user interfaces (AUIs) were exploited in numerous research works as a means to improve the usability of software applications by addressing their usability challenges through these types of UIs. However, a knowledge gap was identified in finding an appropriate adaptive system architecture that can support the adaptation processes in AUIs for mobile ERP apps. Therefore, this paper aims to bridge this gap by presenting an adaptive system architecture that can enable the automatic adaptation for the UIs' components of mobile ERP apps according to the context of use.","","978-1-5386-1986-5","10.1109/IT-DREPS.2017.8277812","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8277812","mobile ERP;adaptive system architecture;usability","Mobile communication;Adaptive systems;Usability;Systems architecture;Adaptation models;Task analysis;Navigation","business data processing;enterprise resource planning;ergonomics;information systems;mobile computing;smart cities;software architecture;user interfaces","adaptive user interfaces;usability challenges;adaptation processes;mobile ERP apps;automatic adaptation;mobile ERP model;smart city concept;ICT application;ERP systems;adaptive system architecture;AUIs","","","","32","IEEE","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this limitation, we introduce the DingNet exemplar, a reference implementation for research on self-adaptation in the domain of IoT. DingNet offers a simulator that maps directly to a physical IoT system that is deployed in the area of Leuven, Belgium. DingNet models a set of geographically distributed gateways, which are connected to a user application that is deployed at a front-end server. The gateways can interact over a LoRaWAN network with local stationary and mobile motes that can be equipped with sensors and actuators. The exemplar comes with a set of scenarios for comparing the effectiveness of different self-adaptive solutions. We illustrate how the exemplar is used for a typical adaptation problem of smart city IoT application, where mobile motes dynamically have to adapt their communication settings to ensure reliable and energy efficient communication.","2157-2321","978-1-7281-3368-3","10.1109/SEAMS.2019.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787065","self-adaptation;exemplar;Internet-of-Things","Logic gates;Internet of Things;Sensors;Smart cities;Quality of service;Servers","computer network reliability;energy conservation;Internet of Things;internetworking;mobile computing;smart cities;wide area networks;wireless sensor networks","self-adaptive Internet-of-Things exemplar;geographically distributed gateways;LoRaWAN network;local stationary mote;mobile mote;Leuven;Belgium;DingNet models;physical IoT system;DingNet exemplar;realistic IoT domains;self-adaptive systems;smart city IoT application","","8","","27","IEEE","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But behind the greatness of the proposed system, whether they are aware of how the characteristics of a city should be. In a city, there are so many diversities of the dynamic elements that make us must have an adaptive system to control it. This paper proposes an approach that has concern for the importance of adaptability to help the city management system. Two type of problems that become the main focus that make why the self-adaptive capability is important are deterministic and non-deterministic problems. The developed key strategy consists of two approaches. First, through series of modification for representing new problem space for solving a deterministic problem. Second, a non-deterministic problem is handled by a system that prepared automatically to search solution. The main objective of this paper is to depict a model to handle both types, through cyber city case illustration.","","978-1-5090-1636-5","10.1109/ICAICTA.2016.7803142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803142","self-adaptive systems;intelligent systems;knowledge representation;rule-based systems;adaptive cyber city","Urban areas;Adaptation models;Context;Context modeling;Monitoring;Informatics;Engines","knowledge representation;smart cities","knowledge representation;adaptive system;intelligent city;smart city;current city management system;self-adaptive cyber city system","","","","18","IEEE","2 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When agents autonomously self-determine the options from which they make choices, while these choices collectively have an overall system-wide impact, an optimal decision-making turns into a combinatorial optimization problem known to be NP-hard. This paper contributes a new generic self-adaptive learning algorithm for a fully decentralized combinatorial optimization: I-EPOS, the Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections. In contrast to related algorithms that simply parallelize computations or big data and deep learning systems that often require personal data and overtake of control with implication on privacy-preservation and autonomy, I-EPOS relies on coordinated local decision-making via structured interactions over tree topologies that involve the exchange of entirely local and aggregated information. Strikingly, the cost-effectiveness of I-EPOS in regards to performance vs. computational and communication cost highly outperforms other related algorithms that involve non-local brute-force operations or exchange of full information. The algorithm is also evaluated using real-world data from two state-of-the-art pilot projects of participatory sharing economies: (i) energy management and (ii) bicycle sharing. The contribution of an I-EPOS open source software suite implemented as a paradigmatic artifact for community aspires to settle a knowledge exchange for the design of new algorithms and application scenarios of sharing economies towards highly participatory and sustainable digital societies.","","978-1-5386-1550-8","10.1109/SEAMS.2017.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7968132","learning;adaptation;optimization;decentralized system;network;sharing economy;smart grid;smart city","Decision making;Bicycles;Topology;Algorithm design and analysis;Cost function;Smart grids","Big Data;combinatorial mathematics;computational complexity;Internet of Things;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;power engineering computing;power system economics;power system planning;smart power grids","fully decentralized combinatorial optimization;economy sharing;Internet of Things democratization;smart grid;smart cities;optimal decision-making;NP-hard problem;generic self-adaptive learning algorithm;iterative economic planning and optimized selections;Big Data;deep learning system;energy management;bicycle sharing;I-EPOS open source software suite;paradigmatic artifact;knowledge exchange","","14","","29","IEEE","7 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

City governments in a growing number of countries are capitalizing on these advances to enhance the lives of their citizens and to increase efficiency and sustainability. In this paper, we elaborate on smartCityRA, a reference architecture for Smart City projects, which serves as the design language for creating smart cities blueprints. Such a blueprint caters for diverse stakeholders, devices, platforms, and technologies. We report on our experience in carrying out a proof-of-concept use case with a major telecommunication provider in the UAE. In doing so, we refined our multiple-view model of the initial smartCityRA reference architecture. We show that Data in smart city applications drive the entire development lifecycle and should be considered early in the development cycle. In addition, Data affects all the other views in the smartCityRA and hence the Data View needs to be at the heart of the entire smartCityRA. Realizing the Data view using a component like a Data Hub helped in creating a central integration location for disparate data from different sources, thus reliving developers from dealing with several entities individually. Finally, we show that any smart city reference architecture, like smartCityRA, should be at the right level of abstraction to enable the flexibility of adoption and adaptation by different stakeholders and components.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397556","smart city;reference architecture;IoT","Smart cities;Meteorology;Feeds;Ecosystems;Stakeholders","data integration;government data processing;public administration;smart cities;sustainable development","Data View;Data Hub;smart city reference architecture;Data driven reference architecture;smart city ecosystems;City governments;Smart City projects;smartCityRA;data integration platform","","9","","16","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus the improvement of resource utilization is a big concern in the management, how to administer such a massive network to meet the requirement of different services? Software Defined Network (SDN) is an ideal solution in customizing networks; however the security feature is the common challenge in both SDN and IoT. In this paper, we propose a framework that uses smart techniques for improving the security features of SDN for smart city applications and diminishing the risk of network invasion. Our SDN Security Framework (SDN-SF) combines two techniques: i) it restrains the unnecessary path between IoT nodes, and ii) it classifies devices into three levels from a combination of MAC address and HTTP request. Additionally, thresholds derived from historical behavior are used for anomaly detection in order to enhance network adaptation. Our result collected from real SDN-based IoT testbed demonstrates that our SDN-SF for Smart City scenarios is able to detect and mitigate malicious traffic with 99.9% of detection rate and 0.5-1 second of detection time in both the control and data plane, respectively.","","978-1-7281-2194-9","10.1109/ICSPCS47537.2019.9008703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9008703","SDN;Security;IoT;Smart City;Network Attacks;Anomaly Detection.","Security;Switches;Smart cities;Real-time systems;Smart homes;Routing","computer network security;home automation;intelligent control;Internet of Things;smart cities;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","smart home;real-time tracking;intelligent control;resource utilization;massive network;security feature;smart techniques;smart city applications;network invasion;SDN security framework;SDN-SF;IoT nodes;network adaptation;SDN-based IoT;smart city scenarios;detection time;software defined network security framework","","1","","17","IEEE","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In multi-robot systems, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is regarded as a promising technology to support decision-making. However, existing MARL approaches assume either a predefined system configuration or a unified model for agents with identical roles, and thus cannot effectively deal with the dynamic change in the number of robots, which is very common in the real world. This kind of ""adaptation"" problem seriously hinders the development of intelligence in multi-robot systems. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-MADDPG approach to enable new robots to integrate into an existing multi-robot system quickly. We build on the MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) algorithm and distill the meta-knowledge of a specific robot team by training a meta-actor and a meta-critic simultaneously. The meta-actor can learn an experienced policy net for new robots to perform reasonable actions directly if the situation is urgent, while the meta-critic trains a value net to criticize the current situation for better evolution of new robots. Our experiments on a typical application case (multi-robot collision avoidance) indicate that the meta-knowledge can significantly improve the fast adaptation for the newcomers.

To analyse such attacks, honeynets and honeypots are deployed to attract attackers and capture their activity for behavioural analysis. Designing honeynets is difficult due to the broad engineering scope of smart cities as a concept, and consequent diversity of smart object characteristics such as communication channels, interaction, data exchange and embedded security. This paper brings order to this diversity and scope by taking a data-centric view of smart city devices. The data-centric view assesses smart devices for their criticality, security and complexity.

In this vision paper, we survey Car-to-Cloud communication applications. Based on the analysis of the varying requirements for these applications, we formulate research questions and challenges. Further, we discuss how these challenges can be addressed by means of an adaptive Car-to-Cloud communication middleware. We conclude with an overview on our activities in this area and an outlook on our planned future work on adaptive communication.","","978-1-5386-9151-9","10.1109/PERCOMW.2019.8730766","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8730766","vehicular communication;cloud computing;smart city;intelligent transportation systems;adaptive communication systems","Real-time systems;Automobiles;Cloud computing;Smart cities;Vehicle dynamics;Routing","cloud computing;driver information systems;embedded systems;middleware;mobile computing;power aware computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","cloud resources;communication technology;computational power;remote embedded devices;smart driving;autonomous driving;entertainment services;mobile vehicle;adaptive Car-to-Cloud communication middleware","","4","","28","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are essentially certain instantiations of Micro-Service architecture, in which, a software application is implemented as a set of ""loosely-coupled services"" [32]. From design perspective, these services are considered as the most fine-grained units implementing business logics. Existing frameworks mostly focus on deployment and management of Micro-Services in cloud. However, the internal management within Micro-Service at thread level and function level does not attract enough attention. These missing pieces are critical for telecom applications, in term of programming model, scalability and performance. In this paper, we present Lite-Service, a new framework addressing device, edge and cloud operation environments in telecom industry. It adopts FaaS, Serverless and Stateless programming models to separate telecom logics from runtimes in order to improve development efficiency and reduce operation cost. The Lite-Service framework features 2 additional runtimes: function-level runtime for complex telecom function scheduling; thread-level intra-service runtime for fast response to load change. An autonomous self-adaptive scheduler and decentralized service management schemes are proposed to enhance performance and service adaptability in different telecom deployment scenarios. Empirical results show that the Lite-Service framework is effective for building and scheduling telecom applications in device, edge and cloud.","","978-1-5386-6614-2","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622861","Serverless, FaaS, Stateless, Autonomous","Telecommunications;Cloud computing;FAA;Runtime;Software;Programming;Computational modeling","cloud computing;service-oriented architecture;telecommunication computing","software application;fine-grained units;internal management;telecom industry;telecom logics;function-level runtime;complex telecom function scheduling;thread-level intra-service runtime;service management schemes;Function-as-a-Service;lite-service framework;telecom applications;microservice architecture;self-adaptive scheduler;business logics;loosely-coupled services;FaaS","","1","","35","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, chip-multiprocessor requires larger on-chip memory as well as a high-end interconnection network. DRAM memory architect using 3D-stacked technology is a promising candidate; however, as the DRAM memory size increases, it suffers due to the overheads related to the DRAM row refreshes. Larger capacity hybrid memories architect using DRAM and PCM technology is a good solution to tackle this problem. Moreover, to utilize the benefits of the large capacity 3D-stacked hybrid memory, studies need to consider the data placement and memory management schemes for these memories. In this work, we have considered a 3D-stacked hybrid DRAM-PCM memory based chip-multiprocessor system. Moreover, we performed an access-aware self-adaptive run-time page mapping to reduce the remote access latency as well as DRAM refresh overheads of the chip-multiprocessor. Our technique performs on an average of 4% better (in terms of the execution time) as compared to the base-case (in base-case, chip-multiprocessor uses non-coherent 3D-stacked DRAM only memory).

However, due to resource crunch issue, not all services can be satisfied at the same time. As each satisfied service is supposed to bring a revenue for the network, the resource crunch will lead to network revenue loss. Given a set of service requests to be provisioned in a flexible optical network, we consider the problem of maximizing the network revenue subject to the physical layer constraint and limited spectrum resource. To mitigate the impact of non-linear interference and assure the quality of transmission, adaptive modulation and FEC are employed. Thus, we formulate a joint optimization problem consisting of routing, modulation, FEC and spectrum assignment. To solve it efficiently, a fast two-phase heuristic algorithm is proposed, which is shown to be near-optimal for revenue maximization. By simulations, we demonstrate that both adaptive modulation and multiple FEC enable to improve significantly the network revenue: Adaptive modulation is preferred in networks with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); while using multiple FEC is more profitable for scenarios with a low SNR.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855340","Flexible Optical Networks;Revenue maximazation;Adaptive modulation;Forward-Errof Correction","Modulation;Signal to noise ratio;Optical fiber networks;Interference;Adaptive systems;Adaptive optics;Nonlinear optics","adaptive modulation;forward error correction;Internet;light interference;optical fibre networks;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","flexible optical network;adaptive modulation;revenue maximization;multiple FEC;network revenue;spectrum resource;spectrum efficiency","","1","","23","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These consequences are avoidable with the introduction of an urban networking fabric for emergency services. We describe here an overall design for a Network for Urban Emergency Services (NUES) that provides essential communication services during disasters and post-disaster recovery. The core of NUES is a dense wireless networking fabric composed of low-cost wireless nodes. Because each node is autonomously powered, and NUES takes advantage of satellite networking services, the overall NUES architecture can be independent of all other (conventional) infrastructure, depending only on users' battery-powered devices (such as cell phones or tablets) and satellite data services. But it also has the ability to exploit conventional infrastructure (in particular cellular wireless) to reduce cost and provide greater bandwidth to users. Since some NUES nodes themselves may be damaged or lost, NUES is also designed for resilience, with redundant nodes connected by a self-healing network. Due to its dense coverage and modular node architecture, NUES also provides smart city sensing services the year around, greatly increasing its cost efficiency.","","978-1-5386-2715-0","10.1109/BigData.2017.8258424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8258424","","Fabrics;Computer architecture;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Logic gates;Urban areas;Bandwidth","cellular radio;disasters;emergency services;satellite communication;telecommunication services","post-disaster recovery;dense wireless networking fabric;satellite networking services;NUES architecture;NUES nodes;redundant nodes;self-healing network;modular node architecture;resilient urban networking infrastructure;smart city services;urban networking fabric;communication services;self-adaptive urban networking infrastructure;disaster services;information networking infrastructure;emergency services;network-for-urban emergency services;battery-powered devices;satellite data services;cellular wireless;dense coverage;cost efficiency;smart city sensing services","","","","19","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Equally important are the system of systems relationships that a failing system has, as these could render a minor system critical under certain circumstances. Infrastructure failure is usually brought under control through system adaptation e.g. using sensor area networks to close valves or by emergency response e.g. extinguishing fires. Current response procedures rely on antiquated information sharing techniques and provide little or no opportunity to effect change within the failing infrastructures systems. There may also be minimal understanding of the important systems of systems role that is being provided by components of the failing system.

The proposed model consists of two parts: an adaptive distillation module and a multi-scale enhancing module. The adaptive distillation block reassigns the channel feature response via adaptively weighting the input maps. And then the important feature maps are separated from the trivial for further focused learning. After that, a multi-scale enhancing module containing two pyramid downsampling layers is employed to fuse the context features for haze-free images restoration in a coarse-to-fine way.

As the most popular southbound protocol and standard, OpenFlow converts network forwarding policies to rule entries and stores them in the flow table. However, the capacity of the flow table is restricted, which can lead to table-overflow if the space is inefficiently used. In this paper, we propose an adaptive flow table management scheme (AFTM) on the control plane, which combines assigning dynamic timeout and proactive eviction to manage the limited flow table resources. The timeout assignment module and the proactive eviction module are not independent parts but work collaboratively. The timeout assignment module sets suitable timeouts for rule entries according to flow characteristics, so that entries of short-lived flows are quickly removed while entries of flows with large packet intervals are retained. When the table space is insufficient, the proactive eviction module removes rule entries to protect the flow table from table-overflow. In our design, the eviction thresholds and parameters in both modules can be adaptively adjusted according to the network load. Experimental results show that AFTM can effectively manage the flow table resource and reduce the number of packet drop rates by up to 81% compared with existing schemes.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00122","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407948","","Protocols;High performance computing;Conferences;Aerospace electronics;Dynamic scheduling;Proposals;Standards","computer network management;computer network security;protocols;software defined networking","adaptive flow table management scheme;software-defined networking;emerging network platform;popular southbound protocol;standard;rule entries;table-overflow;AFTM;flow table resource;timeout assignment module;proactive eviction module;flow characteristics;short-lived flows;table space","","3","","13","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During crisis events, users may post informative tweets about affected individuals, utility damage or cautions on social media platforms. If such tweets are efficiently and effectively processed and analyzed, city organizations may gain a better situational awareness of the affected citizens and provide better response actions. Advances in deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance in many social media analyzing tasks, e.g., sentiment analysis, fake news detection, crisis data classification, etc. However, deep learning models require a large amount of labeled data for model training, which is impractical to collect, especially at the early stage of a crisis event.

However, with the scaling up of high performance computers, the number of processors and computing nodes increase rapidly, which brings I/O impact of checkpointing to the systems. On arriving at a checkpoint, all the nodes generate checkpoint data and write them to the storage system simultaneously, causing burst and massive traffics and data to the I/O infrastructure including interconnection network, parallel file system and storage. To mitigate the I/O impact of checkpointing, this paper proposes a self-adaptive random delay approach to control the writing of checkpointing data. By generating checkpoint data simultaneously in each node and writing the data according to a self-adaptive random delay policy, the burst traffic and data are smoothed. Experiment and theoretical analysis results show that this approach can mitigate I/O impact of checkpointing on large scale parallel systems.","","978-1-5386-6614-2","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00047","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622785","Checkpoint;Fault tolerance;resilience;high performance computing","Delays;Writing;Checkpointing;Software;Hardware;Memory management;High performance computing","checkpointing;fault tolerant computing;input-output programs;multiprocessor interconnection networks;parallel processing;storage management","parallel file system;checkpoint data;scale parallel systems;high performance computing systems;parallel applications;high performance computers;storage system;I/O impact mitigation","","1","","19","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the common manual adjustment is always difficult, time-consuming and error-prone. Therefore there is an urgent requirement of the self-adaptive application server which adjusts its server parameters at runtime. We adopt an approach of hill-climbing based optimization algorithm, which is guided by fuzzy control. After testing it in real scenarios, we find this method may lead to worse performance in some critical conditions compared with the manual way. After further analyzing, we conclude the worse performance resulting from the inaccuracy of monitor and the delay of the process of decision-making. To deal with this problem, we extend the approach with Kalman filter to reduce the deviation of the measurement. At the same time, we deploy a web service in the application server and test the corresponding workload to validate the effectiveness of this self-adaptive strategy.","","978-1-5386-9380-3","10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560241","Application server, self-adaptive system, hill climbing, fuzzy control, Kalman filter","","decision making;fuzzy control;Internet;Kalman filters;optimisation;self-adjusting systems;Web services","Kalman filter based hill-climbing strategy;application server configuration;complicated Internet environment;dynamic Internet environment;common manual adjustment;time-consuming;error-prone;urgent requirement;self-adaptive application server;server parameters;hill-climbing based optimization algorithm;worse performance;self-adaptive strategy","","","","22","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The characteristics of flow in SDN and the impact of flow table entries and controllers on data packet transmission are analyzed. We propose an adaptive flow table adjustment algorithm for SDN called CFC (Combine flow table and controller). It is important for CFC to monitor the network traffic in real time. According to the proportion of active flow entries in the OpenFlow switch, the value of idle_timeout will be set dynamically based on the characteristics of different data flows. When the switch forwards packets, it will minimize the calculation load of controller, and allocate a reasonable value of idle_timeout to the idle flow table entries. So it can delete discarded flow table entries in time and improve the hit rate of data packets. The experiments show that the utilization rate of the flow table resource is enhanced. With the improvement of data packets' forwarding rate, the average throughput of the network has also increased. At the same time, it can also cope with the burst traffic in SDN and ensure them to be forwarded normally and effectively.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855641","Software-defined networking;flow table resource;controller resource;idle_timeout","Switches;Bandwidth;Telecommunication traffic;Real-time systems;Process control","adaptive control;software defined networking;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication switching;telecommunication traffic","adaptive flow table adjustment algorithm;SDN;Software-defined networking;data packet transmission;network traffic;flow table resource;data flows","","5","","10","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most current recommendation algorithms ignore the social relation on users, and the most similarity calculations are based on the common object, which does not fully exploit the implicit information. For these challenges, firstly, an adaptive approach which takes both trust and rating into account is proposed to measure the implicit similarity between a user and his friends when the user as a truster and a trustee, respectively. Secondly, a recommendation algorithm combining trust and ratings is proposed, which also takes the biases of users and items, and the user's implicit feedback into account to enhance the accuracy of the algorithm.

IOT can be the significant option to build up such smart cities throughout the country. This paper is mainly focusing on building such smart cities with high quality identification and adaptation technique of light intensity of the streets with water logging area controlling and monitoring through IOT. This system is controlled by an embedded body configured with ESP12, Node Red, three stage water height detection sensor and LDR module. Through the LDR light sensor the signal gets processed by the Node-Mcu and is sent to the local control room via Internet. Solar panel has been used here as a power source to charge the lithium battery of the device. When the visibility range of light of any street is not up to the mark of human eye visibility range then the data will be sent from local control room to the head control room along with the area location where the street light visibility is not suitable for human eye. In this way the head control room will get a real time system to monitor information of the lightning conditions in a single dashboard display. After analyzing the data the following conclusions can be derived that, it might have been possible that some lights have been damaged or had been stolen. Therefore the visibility range is not up to the mark. More light have to be deployed for proper visibility of that street. Similarly in rainy season the system will operate with the water level sensor to indicate which area of the city is water logged due to heavy rain. The whole system will be deployed in street light posts preferably for easy identification of those areas visibility range and water logging condition monitoring purpose. The system has been planned to develop a smart city for smooth functioning of the human daily life with preventing wastage of energy.","","978-1-5386-4692-2","10.1109/ICRITO.2018.8748798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8748798","Solar panel;Internet of Things;visible light;water level;smart city","Smart cities;Monitoring;Control systems;Servers;Internet of Things;Cloud computing","computerised monitoring;condition monitoring;height measurement;intelligent sensors;Internet;Internet of Things;microcontrollers;optical sensors;signal processing;smart cities;street lighting","smart city development;IoT based street light visibility monitoring;ESP12;LDR module;signal processing;node-MCU;Internet-of-Things;solar panel;single dashboard display;stage water height detection sensor;light intensity;water logging condition monitoring purpose;street light posts;water level sensor;head control room;human eye visibility range;local control room;LDR light sensor","","4","","13","IEEE","1 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Holonic Multiagent System (HMAS) forms a promising approach to software engineering for the modeling and development of hierarchical complex systems. One of the main challenges currently faced in HMAS research is that of social control. In particular, how can the HMAS be configured and organised given their structure of control and regulation? One of the main solutions is to employ the use of norms. Therefore, norms have been proposed as a mechanism for coordinating and controlling of various entities behaviors involved in the system. In this paper, we propose a new model of norms adapted to the holonic structure of HMAS. To do this, (1) we introduce two new types of norms: internal (private) and external (public) norms; (2) we identify and verify the alignment between these two types of norms.

We propose a mechanism that operates in a cognitive radio mode for increasing the channel-reuse rate and decreasing the consumption of redundant channels. The advantage is a heterogeneous-communication interface available through cognitive mechanisms that can recognize different transmission modulation modes. The receiver will get messages through different transmission modulation modes. In this work, we consider vehicles connecting to traffic-congestion computing centers (TCCCs) by vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) communications under a car society. Roadside units serve each segment, and we suppose that every car has a navigation device. We propose an innovative congestion-reducing mechanism that can help vehicles get directions with the help of a navigation device after drivers set the origin location and the destination location. This mechanism can calculate the congestion status of the upcoming segment of road. By tracking roadway segments' status from a point of origin to a destination, our proposed mechanism can handle cross-area car societies. The current study evaluates this approach's performance by conducting computer simulations. Simulation results reveal the strengths of the proposed CA mechanism in terms of increased lifetime and increased congestion-avoidance for urban vehicular networks.","","978-1-4799-5390-5","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.45","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6998291","CA;car society;V2R;traffic congestion;urban vehicular network","Vehicles;Roads;Mathematical model;Navigation;Ad hoc networks;Cognitive radio","cellular automata;recommender systems;road traffic;smart cities;traffic engineering computing","adaptive recommendation segment mechanism;traffic congestion reduction;smart city;cognitive cellular automata approach;CA approach;cross-area car societies;cognitive radio mode;channel-reuse rate;heterogeneous-communication interface;cognitive mechanism;traffic-congestion computing centers;TCCC;vehicle-to-roadside communication;V2R communication;computer simulation;urban vehicular networks","","2","","8","IEEE","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interestingly, most applications in bioinformatics, social networks, and cybersecurity can be represented as large graphs. However, these graphs are sparse in nature. Therefore, TM as a synchronization policy for critical sections can provide better performance since it performs better in low conflict scenarios. Many TM variants exist including: Software, Hardware and combinations of both. Furthermore, a TM can adapt to applications' behavior. In this paper, we introduce DAdHTM.

Storing the data arriving in high volume at IoT gateways or transferring it to back-end clusters for timely processing and real-time response generation is not always feasible, and generally requires considerable overprovisioning of resources. In typical configurations, a computationally capable front-end gateway is available for coordinating the operation of smart devices and for linking them to computation and communication rich back-end infrastructure. It is attractive to harness the computational capabilities in front-end gateways to achieve elasticity of deployment so that the total throughput and response time of IoT solutions can be optimized by intelligent division of labor between devices, front-end gateways, and back-end servers. This paper proposes an Elastic Computing Framework (ECF), an architecture in which programmability of front-end machines is drawn upon to dynamically divide data processing tasks into those that see all of the data but perform simple operations on it, and those that see a transformed subset of the data and extract deep insights from it. This results in lifting the pressure on the network that links the front-and back-ends, and achieves capability adaptive deployment of IoT solutions. In experimental evaluation with one production usage scenario, this approach achieves between six fold and fifty fold reduction in data transferred to back-end clusters, and improves responsiveness by roughly sixteen fold.","","978-1-5090-1893-2","10.1109/SmartCity.2015.138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463792","Internet Of Things(IoT);IoT Architecture;Machine-to-Machine;Interoperability;Real-time Analytics","Real-time systems;Performance evaluation;Computer architecture;Logic gates;Software;Data processing;Computers","Internet of Things","capability adaptive elastic IoT architecture;internetworked smart device;IoT gateways;back-end cluster;front-end gateway;elastic computing framework","","","","20","IEEE","5 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By taking advantage of new information sources offered by the Internet of Things (IoT), cities can rely on sensing platforms to improve their service offer. These sensing platforms, however, raise new research challenges, in particular regarding Quality of Information (QoI). To cope with this issue, common platforms generally provide quality-oriented internal mechanisms. Nevertheless, the configuration of such platforms is complex, especially for Smart City stakeholders that may have various skill levels and different areas of expertise. As a result, QoI assessment is often delegated to end applications where developers have to implement their own adaptation mechanisms. This paper proposes and describes iQAS, an integration platform for QoI Assessment as a Service for Smart Cities. iQAS is autonomic, extensible and configurable, allowing Smart City stakeholders to collaboratively assess and improve (when possible) QoI in real-time.

As people started to move from rural areas into cities, cities started to have congestion, traffic, crimes, increased carbon emissions, illiteracy, and unemployment. Cities have to manage these complexities by finding smart solutions. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has launched the strategy to transform Dubai into a smart city and to be ready for expo 2020 that could result in road traffic and increased tourism. Other reasons for Dubai to become a smart city are that are the business and real estate boom, because foreign investments are pouring in and many populations are coming to Dubai, so it needs to have sustainability. Dubai is in a state where it requires having sustainable energies and buildings to accept many populations. A framework is a set of principles and guidelines to prepare the right components and people, and taking the right steps and stages to achieve the outcomes. A roadmap is a vision done by stakeholders, of the final outcome of the desired project, and it takes from 10 to 50 years. A roadmap is a plan or strategy intended to achieve a particular goal. This research has studied various smart city initiatives in the world and the numerous frameworks on smart cities.

The protocols behave differently under varying load conditions and transaction characteristics. Further, the invocation period of these protocols can be controlled to improve performance when the overhead tends to become large. The performance of these protocols has been demonstrated using a distributed real-time transaction processing simulator which provides an interactive interface to set parameters, and also has provisions to select from a variety of concurrency control, priority assignment, workload distribution and other protocols. The impact of transaction workload, underlying system configuration, resource availability, detection rates, and congestion on each of the proposed protocols is observed and presented.

In fact, IoT plays a prominent role in the realization of the smart city paradigm. One of the highly demanded services in a smart city infrastructure is to enable Networked Virtual Environment (NVE) class of applications, like collaborative Augmented Reality (AR), virtual walkthroughs, and Massively Multiplayer Online games (MMOGs), on mobile things. Perversely, pre-downloading and rendering a complex 3D graphics is very computationally intensive and neither commensurate with the current mobiles hardware specifications and their dynamic mobility natures nor with the available wireless bandwidth. In addition, most IoT environments are generally deployed via a service-centric architecture which obviously suffers from a single point of failure, service latency, and scalability issues between IoT gateways and mobile devices. In order to address these problems, a framework that combines the pros of both central and distributed based schemes has been proposed. The proposed hybrid framework, referred to as STREAMIT, facilitates the 3D texture streaming over thin devices to cope with the mobile hardware resources and alleviate the challenges of client-server and ad-hoc 3D streaming. In addition, STREAMIT implements adaptive strategies to select, prioritize, and convey 3D texture graphical objects that only contribute to the user's visible scene.

With modern transportation methods, countries and cities are becoming more interconnected, allowing for less traveling time and efficiency. However, the transportation system nowadays is also facing great challenges. The limited resources cannot meet the ever-growing demand for transportation, the expensive modern lifestyle puts the environment we rely on in jeopardy, the exhaustion of traditional transportation tools damages the health of all living creatures, and the current transportation system even brings about many safety and security issues. Although the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) has been proposed to address these issues in the last century, many connectivity problems are still not considered. In this paper, we evaluate, from the UV perspective, the challenges of the transportation system and the current status of ITS based on a framework of closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision making, and action. We propose that an effective ITS should take into consideration the interaction between the ITS and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home and community, smart medicine and healthcare, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity, and also study how the ITS would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study will help us explore in-depth the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve our modern intelligent transportation system through our innovative methods of accurate static and dynamic information matching based on the redundancy in data acquisition, novel communication mechanism based on multi-dimensional layers of information that ensures the information effectiveness, robustness and self-adaptive methods, and demand-response management.","","978-1-7281-9523-0","10.1109/UV50937.2020.9426197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426197","Universal Village;Intelligent Transportation System;Smart Cities;Closed Loop;Information Flow;Material Cycle;Lifestyle;Community;Mobility;Integration;Resilience;Inclusiveness;Sustainability","Smart cities;Data acquisition;Transportation;Medical services;Tools;Robustness;Safety","data acquisition;decision making;demand side management;feedback;health care;sustainable development;transportation","intelligent transportation system;transportation tools;smart city subsystems;smart energy management;smart city infrastructure;smart response system;UV-oriented solution;ever-growing demand;security issues;safety issues;closed feedback control loop;data acquisition;decision making;smart home and community;smart medicine;healthcare;smart environmental protection;city emergency;smart humanity;information flow;material cycle;UV-oriented;sustainable development framework design;innovative method;dynamic information matching;communication mechanism;multidimensional layers;information effectiveness;self-adaptive methods;demand-response management","","2","","261","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By exploiting the energy-based features extracted from spectral sub-bands the CDT detects changes in time variance in the incoming signal (reactions to the change might follow) as well as disambiguates between changes and aliasing phenomena. When aliasing is detected an adaptation mechanism is activated to adapt the sampling frequency to the real needs of the signal under inspection (so as to reduce energy consumption). This algorithm enhances the state-of-the-art of adaptive sampling by offering an efficient alternative to complete spectral investigation.

One of the major drawbacks with the existing traffic surveillance infrastructure is the need for storing and transmitting the huge video data before processing it. In this paper, we focus to enable the intelligence of traffic system as well as eliminate the need for storing and transmitting big data. To achieve this, we propose a real-time system called traffic pattern collection and analysis model (TPCAM) that aims at collecting and generating the statistics of traffic data at intersections. The system employs deep learning models and real-time algorithms to process live traffic information on a resource constrained embedded platform. However, the achievable frame rate on the most advanced embedded systems (NVIDIA Jetson TX2) is only 3 FPS, which is too low to capture the full moving trace of the vehicles. To improve the frame rate, we further propose deep object tracking algorithm leveraging adaptive multi-modal models and make it robust to object occlusions and varying lighting conditions. Based on the deep learning based detection and tracking, we can achieve pseudo-30FPS via adaptive key frame selection.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397674","traffic surveillance;real-time traffic data;edge computing;deep learning;multiple object tracking","Object tracking;Real-time systems;Cameras;Target tracking;Optical imaging;Analytical models","embedded systems;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;object tracking;real-time systems;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;video signal processing;video surveillance","TPCAM;robust traffic surveillance;urban traffic control systems;traffic system;real-time system;traffic data;deep learning models;traffic information;advanced embedded systems;deep learning based detection;data storage;big data;statistics;real-time traffic pattern collection;traffic surveillance infrastructure;deep object tracking algorithm;adaptive multimodal models;traffic pattern collection and analysis model;NVIDIA Jetson TX2;object occlusions;lighting conditions;huge video data transmission","","3","","20","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Subsequently, the directional rectangular patches are rotated to coincide with the direction of the texture and the search windows are adaptively adjusted to match the local characteristics of the regions.

In this paper, we present a novel optimization of SLINK algorithm, GridSLINK, which is an order of magnitude faster than the existing state-of-the-art implementation. The optimization in GridSLINK comes from reduction in number of distance calculations required by SLINK. This reduction is achieved by exploiting spatial locality of data points and using an adaptive gridding technique. GridSLINK is parallelized for distributed memory systems. Scalable performance is achieved for increasing number of compute nodes.

In this paper, we propose a latent factor model based traffic signal timing plan recommendation method to address this problem. In the proposed method, we model the abstract traffic states as the “users” in recommendation systems, and timing plans as the “items”. And there are many explicit or implicit factors in the interactions between “users” and “items”. The latent factor model is successfully used to deal with uncertain factors which cannot be modeled accurately in math. The novel method adopted the model-free adaptive idea to solve the problem of modeling from the perspective of data mining and machine learning framework. And, the proposed method is tested by using simulation data generated by a microscopic traffic simulator called Paramics. The results are compared to the baseline Webster method.

This integration has ushered in an era of smart city intelligent transportation services that are dynamic, adaptive and can be reconfigured to meet the smart city citizenry's changing needs in an inclusive, safe, greener, and more efficient way. We believe that by adapting and, in some cases repurposing the SC-ITS, the authorities can simultaneously increase the reach, impact, and efficacy of the solutions aimed at restarting economies while balancing both lives and livelihood concerns. This paper builds an understanding of the pandemic and then examines the SC-ITS through its components and related applications before diving deeper into the hood to examine how these components, both now and in the future, can be adapted, reconfigured and repurposed, to address the pandemic induced challenges individually and collectively. Finally, it attempts to put a perspective by evaluating the challenges and opportunities inherent in leveraging the ITS for the deployment.","","978-1-6654-0394-8","10.1109/iSCI50694.2020.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9346428","Intelligent transportation system;Smart cities;Pandemic;Information technology","Economics;Pandemics;Smart cities;Transportation;Muscles;Planning;Artificial intelligence","artificial intelligence;intelligent transportation systems;logistics;public administration;smart cities;transportation","artificial intelligence;Smart Cities;smart city intelligent transportation services;smart city citizenry;pandemic induced challenges;pandemic induced threats;world wars;economy;pandemic COVID-19;big change;challenging authorities;people movement;national governments;local governments;Smart City's Intelligent Transportation System;transportation advancements","","","","39","IEEE","11 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A light emitting diode (LED) acts as a transmitter in VLC system. However, the nonlinear characteristics and dimming nature of LED limits the performance of the VLC system by degrading the quality of transmitted signal. In this paper, we propose an adaptive-learning-architecture (ALA) based predistortion technique to estimate and compensate for LED nonlinearities as well as increase the spectral efficiency of a VLC system. A DC-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DCO-OFDM) signal is considered. The performance with and without predistorter is analysed assuming optical line-of-sight (LOS) channel. It is shown that degradation due to LED nonlinearity can be compensated by using ALA-based predistortion, and the overall Predistorter-LED system is able to approach near-linear performance. Further, we investigate the impact of dimming on the performance of nonlinear LED in VLC system. Simulation results based on symbol error rate (SER), amplitude distortion (AM/AM) curves and constellation plots validate the performance of our proposed technique.","","978-1-5386-2347-3","10.1109/ANTS.2017.8384165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8384165","DCO-OFDM;VLC system;LED nonlinearity;Adaptive learning architecture;Dimming control","Light emitting diodes;OFDM;Optical distortion;Nonlinear optics;Nonlinear distortion;Predistortion;High-speed optical techniques","free-space optical communication;light emitting diodes;OFDM modulation","adaptive predistortion technique;VLC system;nonlinear LED;dimming control;light emitting diode;DC-biased optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal;DCO-OFDM signal;optical line-of-sight channel;Predistorter-LED system;LED nonlinearity;adaptive-learning-architecture based predistortion technique;LED limits;visible light communication system","","8","","31","IEEE","14 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the fact that transporting quantitative congestion information is cost-prohibitive through current Congestion Propagation Networks (CPN), state-of-the-art adaptive routing algorithms tend to exploit qualitative congestion information. Unfortunately, qualitative congestion information can not provide a precise view of the network congestion level and hence mispredict network congestion in some cases, which easily leads to suboptimal routing decisions. To address this problem, this paper proposes the Quantitative Congestion Awareness (QCA) technique, which collects non-local quantitative congestion information by transferring the difference instead of the absolute value of the desired congestion metrics, such as the number of free virtual channels. With QCA technique, the cost of CPN is minimized and fixed since only one wire per destination is required regardless of the size of network and number of virtual channels per physical channel. A novel adaptive routing algorithm combining both congestion avoidance scheme and comprehensive evaluation scheme is proposed to fully exploit the properties of quantitative congestion information and make optimal routing decisions. With extensive simulations, the results show that the throughput could be improved up to 17.13% compared with state-of-the-art routing algorithms.","","978-1-5090-4297-5","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828381","adaptive routing;congestion-aware;quantitative congestion information","Routing;Wires;Ports (Computers);Adaptive systems;Measurement;Prediction algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis","network routing;network-on-chip","congestion-aware adaptive routing;networks-on-chip;NoC;network congestion prediction;congestion propagation networks;qualitative congestion information;quantitative congestion awareness;QCA technique;nonlocal quantitative congestion information;free virtual channels;congestion avoidance scheme;comprehensive evaluation scheme;optimal routing decisions","","3","","19","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Usually, IoT-based smart city applications operate in isolation, leading to a fragmented IoT landscape that hinders the managements of the IoT systems in an integrated way. Thus, it is required the involvement of city authorities to structure and organize city-wide interventions among the different IoT systems/applications; but also it is needed the infrastructure and technology that allow these city-wide interventions between the different levels of government (from upper tier authorities to down tier) for the proper management of heterogeneous IoT systems deployed within a Smart City by public as well as private entities. In this paper we propose an infrastructure for the Smart Governance of heterogeneous IoT solutions within Smart Cities, which provides useful features such as the spread of power, security constraints and scalability, among others. The infrastructure is described through 1) a new architectural model, as an adapted version of the basic architectural model, 2) the use of Digital Objects as crucial artifacts to represent, store and interact with physical and digital elements and 3) the use of open-source technology to implements the architectural model and supports the management of the Digital Objects.","2687-8860","978-1-7281-8294-0","10.1109/ISC251055.2020.9239077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9239077","internet of things;digital object;smart governance;smart city;infrastructure;heterogeneous","Adaptation models;Smart cities;Scalability;Government;Internet of Things;Security;Open source software","Internet of Things;security of data;smart cities;software architecture;town and country planning","digital object-based infrastructure;smart governance;heterogeneous Internet of Things;smart city ecosystem;city authorities;city-wide interventions;government;upper tier authorities;heterogeneous IoT systems;architectural model;security constraints;digital elements;open-source technology","","3","","26","IEEE","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most MADRL cases, agents are trained only to deal with specific tasks, so once there are unpredictable changes in target tasks, the earlier trained-models might no longer work, and agents have to get trained again from scratch in limited time, which means traditional MADRL is unsuited to unpredictable post-disaster environments. In order to promote the scalability and flexibility of the multi-agent system, meta-learning, which has achieved few shot learning successfully in supervised deep learning field, could reuse the earlier models as the prior knowledge to guide and speed up the new task learning process. In this work, we propose a framework to apply meta learning methods to multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), and achieve efficient adaption to new tasks with less time and fewer samples. Some common experiences in the previous tasks learning will be refined as the meta knowledge. Once the tasks get changed with new scenarios, agents will get retrained with good initial network parameters based on this meta knowledge. Although the new scenarios might be different from the previous scenarios, agents could quickly adjust their policy and get better performance within only few episodes. In two experiments, our method performs better learning efficiency than others, getting higher rewards in the first several episodes of new tasks learning.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060109","meta learning;multi-agent deep reinforcement learning;few-shot learning","Task analysis;Training;Machine learning;Learning systems;Learning (artificial intelligence);Robots;Adaptation models","control engineering computing;disasters;emergency management;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;rescue robots","task learning process;earlier models;supervised deep learning field;meta-learning;multiagent system;unpredictable post-disaster environments;traditional MADRL;trained-models;target tasks;unpredictable changes;MADRL cases;robotic applications;disaster rescue;multiagent deep reinforcement learning;meta learning;fast adaptation;learning efficiency;meta knowledge;multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient;learning methods","","2","","14","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Renewable energy resources will be an important part of power generation in the future. Use of solar energy reduces emission of greenhouse gases. Solar energy is completely free of cost and widely available. Solar energy generation is largely dependent on the intensity of solar radiation. The changing position of sun causes to have different sun intensity in different seasons as well as different times of the year. Therefore, by using solar tracking devices solar energy generation can be increased than the conventional system. Sun trackers can increase the collected energy between 10% to 100% based on geographical conditions. This paper studies the zenith and azimuth angles required for the position of the sun in the sky. This paper studies two types of solar tracking systems such as single axis and double axis tracking systems. Based on the study it is found that overall efficiency of the system can be increased with the help of mechatronics devices such as sensors, motor, microcontroller and battery and above mentioned two solar tracking systems.

In order to have a meaningful ITS, availability of statistics such as types of the objects (vehicles, human, etc.) in motion and their statistics and interaction with the environment, are important. Automatic classification of moving objects is an important step for building real-time traffic monitoring systems. This helps to get the statistics of the scene and categorization of the objects into different classes such as human, vehicles of different types etc. It can also give the count of different types of vehicles on the road. Such classification helps to narrow down the search while locating vehicles of interest. We present a new approach for classification of moving objects in videos based on Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM). The inference scheme has been built using the size of the connected components to identify the objects into meaningful classes. Our experimental validation with publicly available datasets reveals that the proposed method can classify moving objects with reasonably high accuracy applicable to real-time traffic analysis. We also emphasize on how chaotic traffic conditions of the city roads can be, thus highlighting the need for having systematic control of the traffic and rule enforcement.","","978-1-5090-6255-3","10.1109/TENCONSpring.2017.8070028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8070028","Traffic Estimation;Vehicle Classification;Gibbs Sampling;Dirichlet Process Mixture Model;Semi-supervised;Active learning;Road Safety","Videos;Roads;Real-time systems;Mixture models;Cameras;Feature extraction;Smart cities","adaptive control;image classification;image motion analysis;intelligent transportation systems;mixture models;object detection;object recognition;road traffic control;smart cities;traffic engineering computing","intelligent transportation system;adaptive control;automatic classification;real-time traffic monitoring systems;Dirichlet Process Mixture Model;DPMM;real-time traffic analysis;chaotic traffic conditions;city roads;rule enforcement;road traffic management;real-time moving object classification;smart city build-up;statistics;road vehicles;object identification","","2","","23","IEEE","19 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

High-volume, high-velocity data emitted by IoV applications introduces issues with efficient spatial and temporal queries over massively redundant datasets, typically represented as a collection of longitude-latitude tuples. In this paper we present SMTP, a new storage method based on the recognition of trajectory patterns to reduce the storage space for the trajectory data. An adaptive algorithm for mining trajectory patterns from the data is developed, and it recognizes frequent trajectories as patterns according to the geo-space relationships between trajectories. A combinatorial optimization algorithm is then introduced to decide which trajectory patterns should be used for trajectory storage, thereby removing redundant data and saving space. The recognized and saved patterns also help to accelerate queries to the trajectory data. Several large IoV datasets from the real world are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show that storage space for trajectory data can be reduced by 38% while a typical query to the data can be accelerated by approximately 40%.","","978-1-5090-4297-5","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828453","IoV;Trajectory Patterns;Trajectory Pattern Mining;Vehicle Trajectories","Trajectory;Roads;Global Positioning System;Vehicles;Data mining;Optimization","combinatorial mathematics;Internet of Things;mobile computing;optimisation;pattern recognition;vehicular ad hoc networks","SMTP;optimized storage method;vehicle trajectory data exploiting trajectory patterns;location-acquisition;mobile sensing technologies;vehicle movements;trajectory datasets;IoV applications;Internet of Vehicles;high-velocity data emitted;longitude-latitude tuples;storage space;adaptive algorithm;trajectory pattern mining;geo-space relationships;combinatorial optimization algorithm;trajectory storage;redundant data;IoV datasets","","1","","21","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, restricted hardware transaction memory (HTM), a hardware feature providing hardware atomicity and isolation guarantees for transactional execution, has gained much attention in the community of database system and becomes a new kind of approach for concurrency control of transaction processing. Previous works show that hardware transactional memory is a very promising mechanism when processing typical OLTP workloads and scales well on multi-core machines. However, the high transaction abort rate caused by capacity overflow is also the major trouble when applying hardware transactional memory in transaction execution under high-contention workloads. Many methods, such as falling back to lock-based approaches, have been proposed to improve the performance when applying hardware transactional memory to transaction execution. In this paper, we analyze the penalty of abort and fall back when hardware transactional memory fails to process transactions. Based on these analyses, we exploit the strengths of hardware transactional memory with an adaptive hybrid mechanism to improve both the throughput and latency of transaction processing on the multicore systems. Our experiment on TPC-C shows that our adaptive design can remarkably improve the throughput and latency of in-memory transaction processing.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00245","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855668","Database, In-memory transaction, HTM, Keyvalue store, Concurrency Control","Hardware;Protocols;Concurrency control;Memory management;Instruction sets;Throughput;Process control","concurrency control;multiprocessing systems;transaction processing","hardware feature;transactional execution;high transaction abort rate;transaction execution;adaptive hybrid transaction processing;advanced hardware features;hardware transaction memory;hardware transactional memory;performance-sensitive software systems;OLTP workloads;database system;capacity overflow;TPC-C;in-memory transaction processing;latency","","","","13","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing prediction methods are generally based on historical time-series data and insensitive to changes of external conditions. In this paper, based on the state-of-the-art deep generative model Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder, we propose a Network Performance Prediction method using Generative Model (NPGM). This method builds the distribution of network latency features according to historical data with traffic taken as condition. Generative model can deal with hidden variables when building the model which traditional methods cannot handle. Following the ideology of phase space reconstruction, we conceal the numerous factors and map the inherent properties of network into a hidden vector. In order to speed up training process, we optimize parameters of neural networks with our Self-adaptive Stochastic Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO) instead of Gradient Descent (GD) algorithms. This approach applies self-adaptive coefficients and mutation operation, which improves training efficiency and searching accuracy. We propose a new criterion called Weighted Matrix Mean Absolute Percentage Error (WM-MAPE) to evaluate the predicting accuracy of latency matrices. We use real commercial backbone traffic data from the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis database. Results on validation sets show that inference error of our approach is less than 50% of time-series-based methods and SPSO has a significantly better efficiency and convergence compared with GD and PSO algorithms.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855403","latency inference;generative model;hidden vector;self-adaptive coefficients;mutation","Conferences;High performance computing;Smart cities;Data science","computer network performance evaluation;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;stochastic processes","neural networks;network state prediction;time-series data;swarm intelligence optimized generative model;deep generative model conditional variational autoencoder;weighted matrix mean absolute percentage error;Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis database;network performance prediction method using generative model;self-adaptive stochastic particle swarm optimization;Web applications;data network","","","","25","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Half of the human population live today in cities and these cities continues to grow exponential growth as people migrate to urban areas in search of a better life. As a result, urban resources are being stretched to their limits to accommodate the population growth. Smart city is a paradigm to manage the difficulty of urban living, upsurge competence, decrease expenditures and advance the worth of its inhabitant's daily life. Countries across the world are adapting to smart cities as it becomes highly critical to explore innovative solutions available to make cities more efficient and smarter. South Africa (SA) needs to leapfrog in terms of the competition through smart cities. SA cities have unique challenges stemming from years of apartheid and neglect of infrastructure. When compared to established cities such as Amsterdam, Barcelona, Copenhagen, London and New York, SA cities are lagging far behind the competitive curve. However, can be mitigated as SA cities through innovative adoption of smart cities can become globally competitive. Furthermore, through the implementation of advanced technologies and lessons learned from established cities that the anticipated growth need not be incremental, but rather will be exponential in many aspects. In light of the above facts, this paper looks into the adaptation of smart cities from a SA perspective by leveraging on the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for different feasible use cases. The smart city initiatives in SA are laid out and the priority use cases are stream lined in lieu of the national priorities as stipulated in the National Development Plan (NDP). A smart city framework for SA is further proposed and the vitally important use cases in the SA context are identified and elaborated. The use cases are then evaluated based on the national Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The scope for future directions and conclusions are sketched towards the end, with an optimism that the current work will be an eye-opener and adaptable to other developing countries.","","978-1-7281-6770-1","10.1109/icABCD49160.2020.9183832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9183832","Internet of Things (IoT);National Development Plan (NDP);Service Delivery;Smart City;South Africa","Smart cities;Stakeholders;Sociology;Statistics;Real-time systems;Unemployment","Internet of Things;smart cities;town and country planning","SA cities;smart city framework;Internet of Things;National Development Plan;key performance indicators;urban living","","1","","15","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the basis of the initial partition scheme, a manual intervention scheme suitable for the procedure is developed according to the importance of procedure, and a new performance evaluation model is used to theoretically evaluate obtained speedups, so that the best partitioning schemes of procedures are identified, exploring the intrinsic law that characteristics of procedures influence their best partitioning schemes. The paper does research from three aspects: calculating importance of procedures, generating the best partitioning schemes of procedures, and building a performance evaluation model, in order to fully exploit the potential parallelism for irregular programs.

State-of-the-art query technology such as FastQuery supports directly indexing of scientific data but does not support in-situ index construction, build index extremely slow and generate huge volume index files. Block index technology coarsely retrieves a large amount of redundant data increasing the filtering overhead. Therefore, this paper proposes a high-performance query data framework for scientific data. In terms of index generation, a two-tier index data structure is designed to build the index in parallel to reduce the size of the index and speed up index generation. Meanwhile, an in-situ kernel index parallel strategy is proposed to build the index for online real-time generated data. In terms of data retrieval, a two-tier parallel query mechanism is designed to efficiently read data, and a dynamic union read strategy and an adaptive scheduling strategy are used to optimize the data retrieval process. Finally, the Bi-Cluster Framework is evaluated on scientific datasets, which proves that our design achieves good performance. The size of the index and index generation time is much smaller than FastQuery. In terms of retrieving data, data retrieval performance has improved a lot. The scalability of Bi-Cluster is pretty good by evaluating on 12288 cores. on scientific datasets, which proves that our design achieves good performance.

Also, the traditional sensors for the traffic flow detection are very expensive, and they are usually not dense enough for a correct traffic monitoring. In order to overcome such problems, there is a space for low cost and fast solutions for dense traffic flow reconstruction. We propose a real-time visual self-adaptive solution to reconstruct the traffic density at every location of a wide urban area leveraging the detections from a few fixed traffic sensors deployed within the area of interest. A such method is based on fluid dynamic models to simulate macroscopic phenomena as shocks formation and propagation of waves backwards along roads. Such physical constraints are applied to a detailed street graph which is enriched by specific parameters representing a weight in terms of traffic road capacity. The weight's assignment has been estimated by a stochastic learning approach at each time slot of the day. The accuracy of the proposed model comes from the error between the reconstructed traffic density and the measured values at the sensor position by excluding each sensor iteratively and reconstructing the flow without it. The proposed reconstruction model has been created by exploiting open and real-time data in the context of Sii-Mobility research project by using Km4City infrastructure in the area of Florence, Italy, for its corresponding Smart City solution.","","978-1-5386-7518-2","10.1109/DASC/PiCom/DataCom/CyberSciTec.2018.000-6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8512000","smart city, reconstruction algorithm, traffic flow, prediction model","Roads;Sensors;Real-time systems;Computational modeling;Smart cities","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic;smart cities;traffic information systems;vehicle routing","civil works;traffic-related data;traffic flow detection;dense traffic flow reconstruction;self-adaptive solution;wide urban area;fluid dynamic models;traffic road capacity;sensor position;reconstruction model;real-time data;Km4City infrastructure;unmonitored roads;real-time knowledge;urban mobility;road-segments traffic densities estimation;smart routing;smart planning;traffic monitoring;real-time traffic estimation;smart city services;navigator apps;smart city solution;stochastic learning","","6","","16","IEEE","28 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such sharing can result in large variations for the performance of applications running in virtual machines (VMs) on same hosts. In this paper, we propose User-APMP, a user-level application performance modeling and prediction frame-work, based on micro-benchmarks and regression techniques for applications that run repetitively in clouds (such as on-line data analytics). Specifically, a few micro-benchmarks are devised to probe the in-situ perceivable performance of CPU, memory and I/O components of the target VM. Then, based on such probe information and in-place measured performance of applications, the performance model can be adaptively developed and refined at runtime with regression techniques. Moreover, sliding-windows are exploited to control the number of historical data items to retrain the model. We evaluate the prediction accuracy for the considered benchmark applications. The evaluation results show that, the prediction error of User-APMP generally decreases with higher adaptation frequencies and more historical data points, which however leads to higher runtime overhead. With only 100 data points, the average prediction errors can reach 25%.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855724","Performance Modeling;Adaptive Prediction;Cloud Applications;Multi Tenant Clouds","Predictive models;Cloud computing;Adaptation models;Runtime;Hardware;Benchmark testing;Data models","cloud computing;data analysis;virtual machines","microbenchmarks;regression techniques;in-place measured performance;historical data items;prediction accuracy;prediction error;User-APMP;multitenant clouds;computing infrastructure;multiple cloud tenants;user-level application performance modeling;prediction framework","","4","","20","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We then evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the smart response system for city emergencies based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action. We propose that effective smart emergency response should consider the interaction between smart response system for city emergency and other seven smart city subsystems: smart home, smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection system, and smart humanity. It should also study how smart emergency response would be affected by four major impacting factors of smart cities: information flow, material cycle, lifestyle, and community. This systematic study enables us to improve preparedness, coordination & adaptiveness, safety, robustness & resilience of the current smart emergency response system and propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable development framework design to address current imminent challenges and improve the response-ability through 1) hierarchical emergency response procedures for individuals, communities, and cities before, during, and after emergencies 2) hybrid, integrative, needed-based data acquisition 3) effective communication channel construction and information sharing 4) adaptive decision-making based on hierarchical knowledge level 5) human-centered and capacity-focused action.","","978-1-7281-9523-0","10.1109/UV50937.2020.9426215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426215","universal village;smart response system for city emergencies;system dynamics;feedback loop;information flow;material cycle;lifestyle;community;smart city","Smart cities;Urban areas;Decision making;Data acquisition;Urban planning;Transportation;Medical services","data acquisition;decision making;disasters;emergency management;emergency services;public administration;smart cities;sustainable development","community;lifestyle;integration;resilience;inclusiveness;sustainability;material cycle;information flow;crowd management;urban planning;healthcare;intelligent transportation;decision-making;data communication;data acquisition;closed feedback control loop;natural-involved disaster;human-involved disaster;UV-oriented solution;city emergencies;smart response system evaluation;smart emergency response system;smart cities;smart humanity;smart environmental protection system;smart city infrastructure;smart energy management;smart medicine;smart home;disaster preparedness","","6","","238","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cyber physical systems are increasing scale and complexity with the growing pervasiveness of ICT and the development of the smart worlds such as smart factory, smart robotics, smart grids, smart cities, smart vehicles, smart healthcare systems, and smart homes. The growing interconnection of physical and virtual worlds of complex cyber physical systems, and the development of increasingly sophisticated intelligence techniques, has given rise to the next generation of CPS, that is referred to as smart cyber-physical systems (sCPS) which can efficiently operate, manage and control physical world and virtual world, and offer broad range of novel applications and services. Thus, smart cyber physical systems are complex cyber physical systems endowed with intelligent abilities. The main characteristic of such a new generation of smart cyber physical systems is the ability to interact with the physical worlds and adapt to new working environments through distributed intelligent mechanisms that executing and operating at the unit (single device), cluster (groups of devices) and network level (the network of devices). The properties like uncertainties, safety, reliability, and performance requirement, spatial-temporal requirement, and adaptation ability are very important, modeling smart cyber-physical systems must face these challenges and satisfy these specific requiremnts. In order to specify and model such kind of systems, we propose a new paradigm for specifying and modeling smart cyber physical systems based on software defined approach using Modelicaml. Software defined approach is a new way that help abstract the real world and virtual world with software components, this approach can simplify system specification, modeling and design. The main aim of ModelicaML is to enable an efficient and effective way to use Modelica, UML and SysML models reusing notations that are also used for software modeling based on software defined approach.

After estimating the signal quality, the signal is classified into a status based on the determined quality. Meanwhile, a suitable filtering method is selected adaptively. The experiments show that the conformity between the final analysis results via the adaptive filtering method and experts' analysis are comparatively higher than when one constant filtering method is used. The adaptive way achieved sensitivity (Se) above 93% and positive predictive value (PPV) up to 94.08% for UC records in the testing set, while the average Se and PPV of the three single-filtering means are separately 78.92% and 86.51%. Other signal-filtering means used achieved lower values. Therefore, the proposed method can satisfy the requirements for automated MFS analysis with improvement in both efficiency and accuracy.","","978-1-5386-1937-7","10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2017.8302209","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302209","uterine contraction;adaptive filtering;comprehensive analysis;classification","Frequency modulation;Filtering;Filtering algorithms;Monitoring;Testing;Filtration;Training","adaptive filters;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;obstetrics;patient monitoring;signal classification","uterine contraction pressure signals;monitoring uterine contraction events;adaptive filtering algorithm;automated MFS analysis;signal-filtering;adaptive filtering method;signal quality determination;automated fetal monitor system analysis","","1","","21","IEEE","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is fundamental to extract value from the information we all are submerged in, thus motivating and supporting the decisions within our cities, which nowadays need transparency and practical evidence. Data visualization tools provide multiple perspectives and are meant to support decision makers, mining available data, with the help of graphical representations in order to ease the emersion of added value, as an initial point from which making inference, reasoning and simulation within our urban environments. And nonetheless, good data visualization provide intuitive evidence. In this paper we introduce a novel 3D urban data analysis framework for the smart city, which exploits the city itself and its buildings to convey data visualization. The novelty is realized thanks to a dynamic geographic tiling which binds the real city structure and the environmental data ""on the fly"", giving the opportunity to see the city changing as the data change. A prototype is proposed, which is based on a micro service architecture, open standards, and an immersive 3D map, aiming to support public decision makers in the process of environmental data analysis. To this extent, the current solution is built on the idea of replicability, accessibility and adaptation: it is location agnostic and does not depend on the particular position where the analysis takes place, it does not need human intervention or adjustments, once the services are instanced, and it is easily accessible, for the interface it is built on a web application.","","978-953-290-105-4","10.23919/SpliTech49282.2020.9243831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9243831","3D Visualization;Data Visualization;Open Source;Open Data;Smart City;WebGL","Three-dimensional displays;Data analysis;Smart cities;Buildings;Data visualization;Tools;Data mining","buildings (structures);cartography;data analysis;data mining;data visualisation;geographic information systems;Internet of Things;smart cities;town and country planning","environmental data analysis;public decision makers;immersive 3D map;data change;city structure;novel 3D urban data analysis framework;good data visualization;mining available data;Data visualization tools;Big Data;smart city;data visualization solution","","","","44","","4 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we propose a filter-based framework called FERA (Filter-based Efficient Request Answering) that combines the concept of fog computing and vehicular sensing. FERA combines the pull/push strategies to adaptively and efficiently gather the requested data in vehicular ad hoc networks. Filters are adopted to control the passage or blockage of the data readings, and requests are directed down to edge nodes or ordinary nodes to further search the requested data. FERA sets and adjusts filters according to their ratio of cost between the push and the pull methods, which effectively pushes the matched data readings upward and blocks the unmatched data readings, saving a large number of message transmissions. Experiments based on real-world road network demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in vehicular sensing applications. Up to 85% of the requests could be successfully processed in the proposed scheme, which is better than existing schemes while at the same time with a relatively low transmission cost.","","978-1-5386-9380-3","10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560158","push/pull, request answering, filters, edge computing, VANET","","adaptive filters;road traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","adaptive filters;urban city;intelligent city traffic management;green city traffic management;fog computing;requested data;vehicular ad hoc networks;FERA sets;matched data readings;unmatched data readings;real-world road network;vehicular sensing applications;pull-push strategies;filter-based efficient request answering","","1","","24","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To improve the encoding efficiency, streaming providers use Variable BitRate (VBR) encoding for video contents, where the video chunks with the same nominal bitrate (video quality) have different instantaneous bitrates and chunk sizes. However, the chunk size variation is assumed to be trivial compared with the network bandwidth variation, and existing bitrate adaptation algorithms simply use the nominal information to make bitrate decisions. In this paper, we present an empirical study of chunk size variation in DASH to explore whether the algorithm can ignore this stochastic factor. We measure the characteristics of chunk size variation based on a rich set of videos and analyze its impact on QoE by trace-driven experiments. Analysis results show that all the buffer-aware algorithms suffer from degraded QoE if they do not consider the chunk size variation. To eliminate the negative impact, we suggest that the bitrate adaptation algorithm should rely on exact chunk size to adjust bitrate instead of the nominal bitrate. To confirm our insights and suggestion, a preliminary solution is proposed and validated based on a real video player and realistic bandwidth traces.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855418","DASH, chunk size, VBR encoding, bitrate adaptation","Bit rate;Streaming media;Quality of experience;Bandwidth;Size measurement;Heuristic algorithms;Estimation","hypermedia;quality of experience;stochastic processes;transport protocols;video coding;video streaming","chunk size variation;video player;Variable BitRate encoding;video chunks;nominal bitrate;bitrate adaptation algorithm;instantaneous bitrates;QoE;quality of experience;Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP;DASH;bitrate decision;stochastic factor;buffer-aware algorithms","","1","","20","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many applications rely on continuous neighbor discovery, i.e., the ability to detect other nearby devices. Application uses for neighbor discovery are widely varying, but they all rely on a protocol in which devices exchange periodic beacons containing device identifiers. Many applications also ultimately involve assessing and adapting to context information sensed about the physical world and the device's situation in that world (e.g., its location or speed, the ambient temperature or sound, etc.). In this paper, we define Proactive Implicit Neighborhood Context Heuristics (PINCH), which leverages unused payload in periodic neighbor discovery beacons to opportunistically distribute context information in a local area. PINCH's self-organizing algorithms use limited local views of the state of a one-hop network neighborhood to determine the most useful type of context information for a device to sense and share. In this paper, we develop the algorithms, integrate an implementation of PINCHwith a smart city simulator, and benchmark the tradeoffs of self-organized local context sharing with 2.4GHz neighbor discovery beacons.","1949-3681","978-1-5386-5172-8","10.1109/SASO.2018.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614286","context sharing;device-to-device coordination","Protocols;Payloads;Task analysis;Intelligent sensors;Schedules;Context modeling","protocols;self-adjusting systems;smart cities","smart city simulator;lightweight battery operated devices;continuous neighbor discovery;periodic neighbor discovery beacons;one-hop network neighborhood;PINCH;proactive implicit neighborhood context heuristics;self-organized context neighborhoods;protocol;self-organized local context sharing algorithms;frequency 2.4 GHz","","4","","27","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a distributed predictive road traffic management system for Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). It aims at predicting the future road traffic along with a continuous adaptation of routes for each vehicle at each junction to minimise driving time and to avoid future congestions in the network. This work highlights communications between vehicles and road-side units and shows how traffic prediction can be achieved in a distributed way without using a central server.

The Storm, as one of the most popular distributed stream computing systems, has received more attention. However, the Storm's traditional scheduling strategy is not ideal for processing a large volume of streaming data. The resource scheduling in a distributed stream computing system should consider not only node allocation status but also fluctuating input rates of data stream. To address this problem, this paper has completed the following work: (1) A performance model La-Stream (latency-sensitive elastic adaptive scheduling) is proposed and built by adopting a quantitative method for calculating the amount of computation required between task map nodes and node communication. (2) A La-Stream based algorithm is proposed. The algorithm dynamically plans a resource allocation scheme with minimal data processing latency among available resources to achieve optimal allocation. (3) Three functional modules of La-steam are proposed and implemented: module Monitor, module Optimizer and module Scheduler. The three modules are integrated into the Storm platform with minimal overhead.

The number of cars on the road is continually increasing and solutions to improve the traffic conditions are mandatory. We cannot prohibit people to use vehicles, but we can help them by using a traffic management system. The purpose of these systems is to update in real-time the timing of traffic signals, to reduce the traffic congestion. ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) is the concept associated with these approaches. The purpose of this paper is to bring a new solution to improve traffic conditions. Starting from a microscopic traffic model, we propose an improvement of OD (Origin-Destination) matrix estimation. This estimation will be capable to lead to better green intervals choosing for traffic signals. Our approach brings a new algorithm for traffic management, at traffic OD volumes estimation level, that combines the probabilistic concept of Bayes inference with absorbing Markov process. These estimations can be further used to update the traffic signals timing and phases.","","978-1-5386-8046-9","10.1109/ICBDSC.2019.8645611","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8645611","Bayes inference;estimation;ITS;Markov process;microscopic traffic;OD","Roads;Markov processes;Estimation;Bayes methods;Microscopy;Volume measurement;Adaptation models","Bayes methods;estimation theory;inference mechanisms;intelligent transportation systems;Markov processes;matrix algebra;road traffic;traffic engineering computing","Bayesian reasoning;OD volumes estimation level;Origin-Destination matrix estimation;Bayes inference;Markov traffic process modeling;traffic signals timing;OD matrix estimation;microscopic traffic model;Intelligent Transportation Systems;traffic congestion;traffic management system","","2","","11","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three driving states are defined and their driving behaviors and decision-making rules are analyzed based on the driver's expectation objectives. The simulation is realized by using the mathematical description the Boid model method of Couzin et al. [6][7][8]. The simulation results show that the behavior change of the individual adaptive driving vehicle is completely consistent with the characteristics of the macro-traffic flow, and the cooperative characteristics of the group intelligence are presented. Individual driving vehicles show good adaptability and self-drive to the change of environment and current traffic condition. The change of individual driving behavior of the vehicle will have an impact on the adjacent local vehicle individuals. The change of traffic density affects the speed of traffic flow. Bad driving behavior will affect the speed of local or even the whole traffic flow on the road, which will lead to the closing and splitting of the vehicle queue.

Risk-based authentication, a form of multi factor authentication adapts itself according to the risk profile of the users. This paper puts forth the design of risk engine integrated with the system to examine the user's past login records and generate a suitable pattern using machine learning algorithms to calculate the risk level of the user.

Aiming at tackling these issues, this paper presents a convolutional neural network-based transfer learning approach. It includes transferring the big data-trained GoogLeNet model into our identification task, fine-tuning the model using the `finetune' idea, and adding three adaptive layers behind the original feature layer.

Due to the high complexity and huge amount of data involved in financial applications, the critical task of constructing appropriate machine learning models will surely become more challenging. Typically, data scientists or researchers may employ various optimizers to enhance the feature selection and/or tuning of the involved hyper-parameters in order to improve the overall performance of the obtained learning models. In this paper, a very flexible optimizer, namely the Adaptive Multi-Population optimization Algorithm (AMPOA), utilizing multiple populations with different search strategies is considered in which two of its variants are carefully evaluated with the other state-of-theart optimizers to enhance the feature selection process of the commonly used K-nearest-neighbor classifier approach on a set of 12 well-known benchmark problems. The first variant named the BAMPOA-R approach employs a rounding technique to determine on the binary decision of choosing an input feature or not for the underlying classifier while the other BAMPOA- T approach utilizes a specific transform function to decide on the feature selection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed optimizer for financial applications, the BAMPOA- R approach with the best performance in the previous test is integrated with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) as the BAMPOA-R-SVR algorithm to compare against other regressors on 10 major financial market indexes. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the remarkable performance of the proposed AMPOA approach to enhance the prediction performances of the underlying machine learning models through more vigorous feature selection for numerous real-world applications including those challenging problems in computational finance.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407936","binary optimization;feature selection;machine learning;metaheuristic algorithms;stock market prediction","Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Feature extraction","feature selection;financial data processing;nearest neighbour methods;optimisation;pattern classification;regression analysis;stock markets;support vector machines","adaptive multipopulation optimization algorithm;machine learning models;computational finance;learned data patterns;financial applications;data scientists;flexible optimizer;feature selection process;BAMPOA-R approach;input feature;BAMPOA- T approach;BAMPOA- R approach;BAMPOA-R-SVR algorithm;K-nearest-neighbor classifier approach;support vector regression;financial market indexes;search strategies","","2","","25","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the algorithm is complex or the dataset is large, the computational cost of algorithm evaluation is very high, which is a major challenge for HPO. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning optimization method for efficient hyperparameter tuning. In particular, an RL agent selects hyperparameters sequentially, thus the search space is greatly reduced. The k-fold cross-validation result is used as a reward signal to update the agent. To speed up the training of the agent, we employ a predictive model to evaluate an algorithm with the selected hyperparameters. However, model inaccuracy is further exacerbated by long-horizon rollout, resulting in collapse performance. We employ a straightforward method to discipline the model rollout in short-horizon. After the short-horizon model rollout, the model is trained again with new samples. The model training and the model rollout are alternately repeated. To fast adapt to new tasks, meta-learning is used to train the predictive model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. We evaluate our approach on 25 datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that with the limited resources, our method can significantly improve the efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian methods and evolution method.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408061","Hyperparameters optimization;Model-based;Reinforcement Learning;Meta-Learning","Training;Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Optimization methods;Reinforcement learning;Predictive models","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;optimisation","hyperparameters optimization;model-based reinforcement learning;meta-learning;hyperparameter optimization;HPO;machine learning algorithms;reinforcement learning optimization method;RL agent;search space;cross-validation result;reward signal;predictive model;selected hyperparameters;hyperparameter tuning;long-horizon rollout;collapse performance;short-horizon model rollout;Bayesian methods;evolution method","","3","","28","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brands want their customers to be in pleasing subliminal scented2 environments because, as research has shown, even a few micro-particles of scent can do a lot of marketing's heavy lifting, from improving consumer perceptions of quality to increasing the number of store visits. Hence, customer venues such as hotels, retail showrooms, casinos, hospitable and other captive audience places employ HVAC (Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) based scent diffusion system that delivers a seamless olfactory [2] experience to connect with consumers on a deeper emotional level, resulting in a more memorable experience. Current state of the art of HVAC dispenser systems, however, uses power hungry deployments [3] to monitor and dispense periodically, without accounting venue-patron occupancy ratios and sudden changes in foot traffic numbers. Thus, resulting sub-optimal user experience that might lead to a poor brand engagement and could incur higher operational costs [5] and thus reduce over all return on the investment (ROI). In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to implement intelligent HVAC dispensing that improve venue experience and operational efficiencies through the application of Big Data Technologies, Edge processing and IoT Sensing. Our system combines a lightweight edge anomaly detection algorithm based on Kalman filter and venue ambient condition to foot traffic graph matrix. The amalgamation of anomaly detection using Kalman filter to the venue ambiance with the application of machine learning creates an adaptive edge and that is our formula to the innovation that we propose and present a prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397583","Adaptive Edge;Internet of things;Machine Learning;Scent Marketing;HVAC;Venue Analytics;Complex Event Processing;Decision Tree;Regression Analysis;Free RTOS;Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency","Decision trees;Kalman filters;Covariance matrices;Wireless fidelity;DC motors;Noise measurement;Image edge detection","Big Data;consumer behaviour;customer satisfaction;HVAC;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);smart cities","suboptimal user experience;heating-ventilation-and-air conditioning based scent diffusion system;edge processing;brand engagement;brand loyalty;smart cities;venue ambient condition;lightweight edge anomaly detection algorithm;venue experience;intelligent HVAC dispensing;foot traffic numbers;HVAC dispenser systems;air conditioning;hospitable audience places;customer venues;emotional connections;venue brand engagement;adaptive edge analytics","","5","","17","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Faults are not so exceptional and in most deployments tend to occur frequently. Therefore, the capability of self-healing is important to ensure higher levels of reliability and availability. We design a framework which provides self-healing capabilities, enabling a flexible choice of components for detection, classification, and correction of faults at runtime. Within our framework, a variety of fault detection and classification algorithms can be applied, depending on the characteristics of the sensor data types as well as the topology of the sensor networks.

In Java, generally full synchronization can be achieved by using synchronized keyword for method and block level or by using various locks of Java concurrency utilities framework. We provide a detailed performance evaluation of these different mechanisms to achieve full synchronization in Java.

Recent efforts devote to approximately representing the higher-order tensors in CNNs without hurting original accuracy. However, the selection of ranks for various decomposition algorithms is still an open problem. We propose an efficient model compression method which leverage Tucker decomposition for global compression. An improved genetic algorithm is applied to selecting and optimizing the ranks for Tucker decomposition. The improved genetic algorithm can also actively detect and get rid of local optimal, which is main drawback of search algorithms. Different decomposition strategies for convolutional layer and fully connected layer are designed based on their dimensional difference. Extensive experiments show that with negligible loss of accuracy, proposed method gives a compression ratio of 7.57× in number of parameters and 2.69× in FLOPs to VGG-19 on CIFAR-100, which has advanced the state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407995","model compression;tucker decomposition;genetic algorithm","Training;Performance evaluation;Adaptation models;Tensors;Computational modeling;High performance computing;Conferences","computer vision;data compression;genetic algorithms;tensors","efficient model compression method which leverage Tucker decomposition;global compression;improved genetic algorithm;ranks;search algorithms;different decomposition strategies;compression ratio;adaptive genetic algorithm;efficient deep model compression;prevalent technique;CNNs;resource-constrained devices;computer vision;higher-order tensors;original accuracy;decomposition algorithms","","6","","22","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing barriers like increased congestion, multiple signalized intersections, queued vehicles, traffic phase timing etc. can prevent emergency vehicles (EVs) achieving desired response times. Existing solutions to route EVs have not been successful because they do not use dynamic traffic parameters. Real time information on increased congestion, halts on road, pedestrian flow, queued vehicles, real and adaptive speed, can be used to properly actuate pre-emption and minimise the impact that EV movement can have on other traffic.Smart cities provide the necessary infrastructure to enable two critical factors in EV routing: real-time traffic data and connectivity. In addition, using autonomous vehicles (AVs) in place of normal emergency service vehicles can have further advantages in terms of safety and adaptability in smart city environments. AVs feature several sensors and connectivity that can help them make real-time decisions. We propose a novel idea of using autonomous emergency vehicles (AEVs) that can meet the critical response time and drive through a complex road network in smart cities efficiently and safely.

This is achieved through accounting for cache utilization in both the message passing and the computational kernel, where it is demonstrated that the optimal domain decompositions not only depend on the communication and load balance but also on the cache-misses, amongst other factors. In this work we demonstrate that those conclusions may also be extended to more advanced numerical discretizations, based upon Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR). In particular, we show that when basing our AMR strategy on the local refinement of patches of the mesh, the optimal patch shape is not typically cubic. We provide specific examples, with accompanying explanation, to show that communication minimizing strategies are not necessarily the best choice when applying AMR in parallel.

A subsequent study improved the implementation by transforming all the operations into addition and multiplication only, which are efficient in current FPGA technology due to the availability of such operations at the hardware level. In this study, the proposed hardware implementation was more efficient and outperformed previous techniques both in terms of speed and area. In addition, a higher clock frequency of around 180 MHz was achieved. This high speed was possible due to sub-dividing the complex operations into smaller computation stages and pipelining all the stages. A prominent feature of the implementation is the use of a pipeline architecture to decrease the chip area requirements and to increase the throughput of the diversity combiner. Using the FPGA implementation on the SIMO channel, the design can be extended to the hardware of spatially modulated massive-MIMO in 5th generation networks.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.0-330","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855466","Field-programmable gate array, generalized maximal-ratio combining, hardwired multipliers, Lyapunov fractal dimension, massive MIMO, maximal ratio combining, pipelining technique, spatial modulation, SIMO channels","Diversity reception;Fading channels;Field programmable gate arrays;Receivers;Transmitters;Signal to noise ratio;Scattering","5G mobile communication;adaptive antenna arrays;diversity reception;fading channels;field programmable gate arrays;MIMO communication;SIMO communication","adaptive array antennas;signal transmission;brute-force technique;square root blocks;FPGA technology;FPGA implementation;wireless single-input-multiple-output fading channels;clock frequency;optimized receiver diversity combining;generalized maximal ratio combining;SIMO fading channels;pipeline architecture;spatially modulated massive-MIMO;5th generation networks","","","","43","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SACC uses the long short term memory model to decide what to cache and then executes caching operation automatically based on the results of the prediction model with no need of manual specifications.

Dynamic regulation modifying the lighting intensity depending on the amount of vehicles and their presence is to help not only meet the requirements of the standard, but also include other parameters of the illumination system, and last but not least to increase power savings and reduce CO2.

This paper proposes a key reassigning and splitting partition algorithm (SKRSP) to handle skew, which considers both the partition balance of the intermediate data and the partition balance after shuffle operator. We design two partition algorithms for different applications: the range-based key splitting partition method (KSRP) for sort operation and hash-based key reassigning partition method (KRHP) for the other operations. We implement SKRSP in Spark 2.2.0 and evaluate its performance through three benchmarks exhibiting significant data skew: Sort, Join, and PageRank.

Therefore, this paper proposes a new algorithm based on the EMS algorithm to further improve the decoding complexity and performance. In order to reduce complexity, an adaptive truncation rule is added to the decoding process. The adaptive truncation rule chooses the length of automatic truncation to reduce the average number of iterations. Thus, the complexity of decoding algorithm is reduced. Besides the weighting factors is added to the variable update iteration process, which effectively improves the decoding performance. The results show that the proposed algorithm has about 0.9 dB gain compared with the EMS decoding algorithm when the bit error rate (BER) is 10--4 and the Galois field GF(q) (q16).","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407981","Nonbinary low-density parity-check;Extended Min-Sum;bit error rate;Galois field","High performance computing;Bit error rate;Decoding;Complexity theory;Delays;Galois fields;Iterative decoding","belief propagation;decoding;fast Fourier transforms;Galois fields;iterative methods;optimisation;parity check codes;telecommunication computing","weighting factors optimization;NB-LDPC codes;extended min-sum algorithm;low-density parity-check codes;belief propagation;adaptive truncation rule;decoding process;automatic truncation;variable update iteration process;EMS decoding algorithm;fast Fourier transforms;extended min-sum;bit error rate;Galois field","","","","13","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose EdgeLD, a new framework for locally distributed execution of DNN-based inference tasks on a cluster of edge devices. In EdgeLD, DNN models' time cost will be firstly profiled in terms of computing capability and network bandwidth. Guided by profiling, an efficient model partition scheme is designed in EdgeLD to balance the assigned workload and the inference runtime among different edge devices. We also propose to employ layer fusion to reduce communication overheads on exchanging intermediate data among devices. Experiment results show that our proposed partition scheme saves up to 15.82% of inference time with regard to the conventional solution. Besides, applying layer fusion can speedup the DNN inference by 1.11-1.13X.

The main problems are mainly due to big data volume and velocity and, in some cases, variety in both dimension and type. A practical approach to understanding and viewing big data features is through streaming operations. Streaming allows for both volume and velocity characteristics of big data, and often, for variety as well. However, performing analytics at interactive rates is currently an open challenge in most big data applications. Cloud computing platforms provide practical support and leverage to solving some of the big data and visual analytics problems, especially when dealing with the volume and velocity characteristics of current data generation. In order to interact with streaming data patterns in an elastic cloud environment, we present a new elastic framework for big data visual analytics in the cloud, the Cloudet. The Cloudet is a self-adaptive cloud-based platform that treats both data and compute nodes as elastic objects. The main objective is to readily achieve the scalability and elasticity of cloud computing platforms in order to process large streaming data and adapt to potential interactions between data stream features. Our main contributions include a robust cloud-based framework, the Cloudet, which can flexibly process the streaming data and applications to illustrate the setup and operations of this framework.

Many prior researches have addressed the heterogeneous memory designs, which attracted both researchers and practitioners. However, the main challenge in memory design is that the moving costs between memories cannot be ignored, such that forming an effective data allocation plan is a critical part for reducing total costs. This paper focuses on this issue and proposes an adaptive energy-aware approach that is designed for efficiently generating adaptive data allocation plans in heterogeneous memories. Two crucial variables are considered the condition constraints, including time and energy consumptions. The proposed method is called Smart Data Allocation Model (SDAM), which is supported by our algorithm, Smart Switch Allocation Algorithm (SA2).

However, this takes a price: these feed-forward networks are unchangeable because of their fixed parameters which mean we cannot transfer arbitrary styles but only single one in real-time. Some coordinated approaches have been offered to relieve this dilemma. Such as a style-swap layer and an adaptive normalization layer (AdaIN) and soon. Its worth mentioning that we observed that the AdaIN layer only aligns the means and variance of the content feature maps with those of the style feature maps.

Furthermore, during the detection, the moving target could travel in dynamic speed and be blocked by dense-obstructer, such as woods and buildings. In this paper, we develop an online drone-based moving target detection (ODMTD)system, which performs moving target detection in dense-obstructer areas.

Second, to detect moving targets in the dynamic background, we develop an algorithm of combing the speed up robust features and approximate nearest neighbors, shortly SURF-ANN, for estimating and compensating the global motion of the background. Finally, in order to calibrate distorted images taken by the camera obliquely, we utilize perspective transformation to remap images into another plane, and then detect moving targets by subtracting registered images (SRI).

Excessive lighting can be banned by targeted dimming of zones of the city, roads or individual luminaires. According to traffic and crowd, the light intensity will be controlled. This paper also incorporates light sensors which will be useful in a rainy environment. Number of street lights will be controlled by the user at a remote place.

This paper proposes a particle swarm optimization algorithm with crossover operator (CPSO) to maximize the use of resources and reduce energy consumption. In the article we designed a new fitness function, which optimizes the algorithm from three goals: load balancing, resource utilization and physical server usage. By adding the crossover operator in the genetic algorithm to the particle swarm optimization algorithm, the fitness value can be prevented from entering the local optimum too early. The algorithm can adaptively adjust the crossover probability and speed up the convergence of the algorithm. Finally, the algorithm is evaluated experimentally. The results show that CPSO is superior to the discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) and greedy algorithm (Best-Fit) in terms of resource utilization and physical machine usage.

One of the main challenges in the scalability of computers hardware is the hierarchy of the memory. Chip-multiprocessors (CMPs) rely on large and multi-level hierarchies of caches to reduce cost of resources and improve systems performance. These multi-level hierarchies are the ones, which also help to solve the issue of limited bandwidth and minimize the latency of the main memory. Almost half of the area of the chip and a large percentage of the system energy is used by caches. One of the main problems limiting the scalability of cache hierarchies is called cache associativity. Caches consume a lot of energy to implement associative lookups. This affects the performance of the system by reducing the efficiency of caches. This paper describes a new design of cache that we called - Adaptive Hashing and Replacement Cache (AHRC). This design has the ability of maintaining high associativity with an advanced method of replacement policy. AHRC can improve associativity and maintain the number of possible locations, where each block is kept as small as possible. Several workloads were simulated on a large-scale CMP with AHRC as the last-level cache. We propose an Adaptive Reuse Interval Prediction (ARIP) scheme for AHRC, which is superior to the NRU scheme that was described by Seznec. Results demonstrate that AHRC has better energy efficiency and higher performance as compared to conventional caches. Additionally, large caches that utilize AHRC are the most suitable in many core CMPs to provide a more significant improvement and scalability than the smaller caches. However, AHRC with a higher-level replacement may lead to loss of energy for workloads that are not sensitive to the policy governing the replacement process.","","978-1-5090-4297-5","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828458","Cache Associativity;CMP;AHRC;ARIP;Hashing;Replacement Policy","Arrays;Bandwidth;Scalability;Indexes;Conferences;Australia;Limiting","cache storage;content-addressable storage","AHRC;optimized cache associativity;hardware resources;memory hierarchy;chip-multiprocessors;CMP;multilevel cache hierarchies;associative lookups;system performance;adaptive hashing and replacement cache;replacement policy;last-level cache;adaptive reuse interval prediction;ARIP","","","","41","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A smart transportation system is at the heart of smart city but cities lag with an efficient transport system. The current public transport systems follows static routing based approach i.e. they have fixed routes and frequency irrespective of the demand. In this paper, we propose an innovative method to solve this problem by rerouting the bus on-the-go based on public demand. Public can interact, manipulate and have an effect on the routing of the buses. The interaction of the public demand with routing is enabled by a central server which will analyses all the demand data collected from booking application. To facilitate the on-demand nature, a dynamic routing algorithm has been proposed that prepares new route for buses in real time. This algorithm works in the cloud server and suggests new and more efficient routes based on the aggregated data collected. This is enabled by the city wide link of equi-important bus depots which serve as loci of control for routing and rerouting. After evaluating, the system shows tremendous performance gain in regions with highly skewed bus-demand. Further, we propose this model to be implemented in public transport systems as a 30 - 70 percent combination of static and dynamic routing respectively for easier adaptation by the commuters.","","978-1-5386-7401-7","10.1109/IBSSC47189.2019.8973089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8973089","Distributed processing;Dynamic Routing;Nodal centre;On-Demand;Public transportation;Real time rerouting;Traffic management","","cloud computing;public transport;smart cities;vehicle routing","public transportation system;smart city;smart transportation system;demand data;dynamic routing algorithm;city wide link;skewed bus-demand","","","","8","IEEE","30 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

HF-BF first separate the large address space into independent sub-spaces and adopt a fine-grained Bloom filter to terminate the unique address checking process in advance once a fault feedback is returned by one hash function. A scalable Bloom filter approach is used in HF-BF to deal with the continuous growing incoming addresses. To further improve system throughput, HF-BF propose an adaptive memory management algorithm to leverage the temporal locality of the input address checking process of transactions. We have implemented HF-BF into a representative DAG-based blockchain system-IOTA. We build a private IOTA network based on the implementation and conduct a serious of experiments.

New applications demand the ability to cope with dynamic environments like data streams with transient behavior. Such environments present new requirements like incrementally process incoming data instances in a single pass, under both memory and time constraints. Furthermore, prediction models often need to adapt to concept drifts observed in non-stationary data streams. Ensemble learning comprises a class of stream mining algorithms that achieved remarkable prediction performance in this scenario. Implemented as a set of (several) individual component classifiers whose predictions are combined to predict new incoming instances, ensembles are naturally amendable for task parallelism. Despite its relevance, an efficient implementation of ensemble algorithms is still challenging. For example, dynamic data structures used to model non-stationary data behavior and detect concept drifts cause inefficient memory usage patterns and poor cache memory performance in multi-core environments. In this paper, we propose a minibatching strategy which can significantly reduce cache misses and improve the performance of several ensemble algorithms for stream mining in multi-core environments. We assess our strategy on four different state-of-art ensemble algorithms applying four widely used machine learning benchmark datasets with varied characteristics. Results from two different hardware show speedups of up to 5X on 8-core processors with ensembles of 100 and 150 learners. The benefits come at the cost of changes in predictive performances.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00018","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407935","Multicore task-parallelism;data-stream learning;ensemble learners;bagging algorithms","Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Multicore processing;Heuristic algorithms;Memory management;Parallel processing;Prediction algorithms","cache storage;data mining;data structures;learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems;pattern classification","improving parallel performance;ensemble learners;data locality;mini-batching;Machine Learning techniques;virtually all domains;dynamic environments;transient behavior;incrementally process;data instances;time constraints;prediction models;concept drifts;nonstationary data streams;ensemble learning;stream mining algorithms;remarkable prediction performance;individual component classifiers whose predictions;incoming instances;task parallelism;dynamic data structures;nonstationary data behavior;inefficient memory usage patterns;poor cache memory performance;multicore environments;state-of-art ensemble algorithms;widely used machine;predictive performances","","3","","30","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although edge resources, such as cloudlets, may alleviate some of the latency concerns, there is a general lack of mechanisms that can dynamically manage resources across the cloud-edge spectrum. To address these gaps, this research proposes Dynamic Data Driven Cloud and Edge Systems (D3CES). It uses measurement data collected from adaptively instrumenting the cloud and edge resources to learn and enhance models of the distributed resource pool. In turn, the framework uses the learned models in a feedback loop to make effective resource management decisions to host applications and deliver their QoS properties.

According to the principle of information theory and the spatial modulation scheme of uniform selection (US), the upper and the lower bounds on the secrecy rate for SM based VLC are derived, respectively. Numerical results show that the performance gap between the upper and lower bounds of the secrecy rate is small and relatively close, which indicates that the derived secrecy rate bounds can be used to evaluate the system performance. Moreover, when the number of transmitters is set to be one, the spatial modulation disappears, and the secrecy rate bounds in this paper are consistent with the existing results. To further improve the secrecy performance, a channel adaptive selection (CAS) scheme is proposed for selecting the active transmitter.

At high level, metaheuristic search establishes resource constraints for each aCell and determines parameters for the task-level operation scheduling. At low level, the task-level scheduling algorithm produces feasible assignments and schedules within a single aCell by backtracking through feasible time slots using an adaptive score metric. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it clearly delineates between higher level state space exploration and focused, task-oriented exploitation.

Even though a lot of research has been invested in the last decade on this domain, there are still certain aspects that remain controversial and unidentified, especially in terms of socio-economic characteristics. To address this challenge, a new survey is proposed, publicly available through Zenodo, that covers a variety of different aspects that include both technical and socio-cultural traits aiming to fully depict the factors/drivers that affect occupant energy-related behavior at tertiary buildings and correlate them with 15 known strategies of persuasion to motivate people to behave pro-environmentally. The survey was deployed in four EU countries, six different cities and seven buildings, resulting in a total of 330 responses. Among different results, the descriptive analyses show that even though 40% of the total sample was still hesitating to behave pro-environmentally at their workplace, over 90% of all respondents had a positive attitude towards it. Finally, the prescriptive analysis revealed that only five socio-economic factors actually show dependencies on persuasive principles, with the most promising one being the willingness of employees to join a pro-environmental campaign in the work center. Besides, it was found that Praising people for behaving energy efficiently showed correlation with more than one factor which is in line with the literature.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00321","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060404","occupant behavior, socio-economic survey, energy efficiency, persuasion","Buildings;Employment;Economics;Energy consumption;Urban areas;Biological system modeling;Adaptation models","behavioural sciences computing;building management systems;energy conservation;human factors;power engineering computing;socio-economic effects","occupant energy-related behavior;tertiary buildings;socio-economic factors;pro-environmental campaign;socio-economic survey;self-perceived effectiveness;persuasive strategies;human energy behavior;socio-economic characteristics;socio-cultural traits;energy efficiency","","","","40","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study proposes an example of vehicle-infrastructure cooperative function which would be incorporate into vehicle safety system for smart city application. Driver's state adaptive driving support safety function may be one of key functions that can bring road traffic safety in combination with road infrastructure interactively. Consequently this study clarified root cause of traffic accidents by analysing data of experiences on traffic incidents. Data was collected by two methods, one was collected through direct interview, and the other was collected through Internet. From the analysis, haste, distraction were major factor of a driver's psychosomatic states just before traffic incidents. As an alternative characteristic of driver's cognitive distraction, this study acquired physiological information, which were movements of eyes and head, and heart rate. A method of detecting driver's cognitive distraction was established by using pattern recognition, which were AdaBoost and Error-Correcting Output Coding (ECOC). This study proposes driver's psychosomatic adaptive driving support safety function in combination with ITS service for smart city applications.","","978-1-4799-8442-8","10.1109/ICDEW.2015.7129561","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7129561","internet survey;ITS;traffic incidents analysis;next generation safety unit for smart car;pattern recognition;AdaBoost","Vehicles;Safety;Accidents;Heart rate;Magnetic heads;Internet;Roads","data mining;error correction codes;groupware;intelligent transportation systems;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;road safety;smart cities","data mining;safety transportation;Internet survey;Big Data;intelligent transportation system;ITS;smart city;safety driving;traffic congestion;vehicle-infrastructure cooperative function;traffic accidents;physiological information;drivers cognitive distraction;pattern recognition;AdaBoost;error-correcting output coding;ECOC","","4","","11","IEEE","22 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper deals with providing a surveillance technology based on speech recognition for citizen security without affecting the privacy of citizens. To this aim, a prototype software component for the automatic detection of situations of insecurity based on speech recognition, natural language processing, and pattern recognition is proposed. This component provides an automatic surveillance service that allows detecting in real time the occurrence of situations of insecurity, generate security alerts to help mitigating such situations, and report/record the occurred events. The software component minimizes the invasion of privacy of citizens, since speech recognition is performed entirely local, with no access to the Cloud. It also avoids the registration of any dialogue or conversation in which no situation of insecurity has been detected. The implemented prototype is evaluated with simulated situations of insecurity taken from Argentinian's movies and with real cases taken from videos recording criminal acts in different cities of Argentina.

Our results also show that round-robin for job allocation is better than the serve-near as it can serve more orders, generate more profit, minimise client waiting time and maximise client satisfaction. The results from the adaptive and committed scenarios do not vary for the round robin system. However, for the serve-near system, the adaptive scenario is better on all fronts.

Video buffering mechanisms are often used to ensure visual continuity and fluency; however, too much buffering time can add picture delay which cannot be stood for real-time video presentation, while insufficient buffering time cannot guarantee video presentation quality. Due to uncertain and changeable network traffic status, there is no appropriate buffering time could be used. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic adaptive video buffering mechanism, which can minimize picture delay while keeping video presentation quality. While receiving video frames as soon as possible and putting them into video buffer queue, we tune video playing speed in the form of uniformly accelerated motion by judging video frames count in video buffer queue. For tuning video playing speed in the form of sinusoidal waveform, its process is similar. They all need to update the PTS (presentation timestamp) of video frames according to the video playing speed. Related derivation process is given in detail. The calculated results show that it can absorb some network jitter.","","978-1-5090-6352-9","10.1109/CompComm.2017.8322897","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8322897","component;video living broadcast;network jitter;video buffering mechanism;playing speed tuning;uniformly accelerated motion;presentation timestamp","Streaming media;Acceleration;Tuning;Jitter;Delays;Real-time systems;Bandwidth","IP networks;jitter;telecommunication traffic;video signal processing;video streaming","video buffering mechanisms;picture delay;real-time video presentation;uncertain network traffic status;changeable network traffic status;appropriate buffering time;dynamic adaptive video buffering mechanism;video buffer queue;video frames count;tuning video playing speed;network jitter;network bandwidth status;network congestion;wireless network;network bandwidth unstable;video presentation quality;mobile Internet environments;uniformly accelerated motion;sinusoidal waveform","","1","","12","IEEE","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the sparse matrix representation has a significant impact on the resulting application performance, choosing the right representation typically relies on expert knowledge and trial and error. This paper provides the first comprehensive study on the impact of sparse matrix representations on two emerging many-core architectures: the Intel's Knights Landing (KNL) XeonPhi and the ARM-based FT-2000Plus (FTP). Our large-scale experiments involved over 9,500 distinct profiling runs performed on 956 sparse datasets and five mainstream SpMV representations. We show that the best sparse matrix representation depends on the underlying architecture and the program input. To help developers to choose the optimal matrix representation, we employ machine learning to develop a predictive model. Our model is first trained offline using a set of training examples. The learned model can be used to predict the best matrix representation for any unseen input for a given architecture. We show that our model delivers on average 95% and 91% of the best available performance on KNL and FTP respectively, and it achieves this with no runtime profiling overhead.","","978-1-5386-6614-2","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622854","Sparse matrix vector multiplication, Performance optimization, Many-Cores, Performance analysis","Sparse matrices;Random access memory;Two dimensional displays;Predictive models;Arrays","learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;matrix multiplication;sparse matrices;storage management;vectors","sparse matrix-vector multiplication;sparse matrix vector multiplication;high-performance applications;application performance bottleneck;sparse matrix representation;mainstream SpMV representations;optimal matrix representation;many-core architectures;sparse datasets;ARM-based FT-2000Plus","","16","","52","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simulation has been the dominant research methodology of validation. However, it is becoming clear that simulation does not sufficiently capture the network capacity irregularity of a real mobile network, especially with mobility. The researchers tend to evaluate their optimizations using prototype implementations by real world experiments. Instead of directly running time and cost intensive field test, it is more efficient to evaluate the optimizations on the mobile network testbed. Only when the transmission characteristics of the testbed is similar to those of the actual mobile network, will the results be meaningful to guide further works. In this paper, we emulate experimental scenarios on the mobile network testbed by tuning the testbed configuration parameters. In these scenarios, the testbed has similar transmission characteristics to the actual mobile network. We build a transmission characteristics data set from a real world mobile network, and train the similarity model through metric learning to guide building experimental scenarios on the testbed. The results show that the proposed similarity model outperforms state-of-the-art similarity models. We also verify that the experimental scenarios really reflect real world scenarios by evaluating the QoE of HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) on the testbed and the actual mobile network.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00103","National Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Education; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407950","Mobile Network Testbed;Experimental Scenario;Transmission Characteristics Similarity","Cellular networks;Adaptation models;5G mobile communication;Buildings;Time series analysis;Prototypes;Mobile video","hypermedia;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;quality of experience;transport protocols;video streaming","experimental scenarios;state-of-the-art similarity models;actual mobile network;mobile network testbed;transmission characteristics similarity model;mobile video streaming service;network capacity irregularity;optimizations;testbed configuration parameters;similar transmission characteristics;transmission characteristics data;world mobile network","","","","26","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The drawback of that approach is that it is not suitable for solving large problems. This paper presents a multiple-retrieval approach that partitions the attribute graph of the large problem into small solvable sub-problems by recursively inputting the unsolved part of the graph into the decision tree for retrieval. The adaptation combines the retrieved partial solutions of all the partitioned sub-problems and employs a graph heuristic method to construct the whole solution for the new case.

However, when the test set and training set contain different marine background noises, the performance of the trained model deteriorates. According to our observations, such problem cannot be solved by traditional noise reduction techniques and alleviating overfitting. Considering the complexity of marine background noise and the dissimilarity in transmission channels under different marine conditions, we first compare various marine conditions to different generalized channels so that this problem can be compared to channel mismatch in the field of speaker recognition. Inspired by domain adaptation and channel compensation, we propose a Generalized Channel-Invariant Network (GCIN), which uses a gradient reversal layer (GRL) and an adversarial training framework to eliminate the dissimilarity in the received data caused by various marine conditions and then a more robust model is obtained. Experiments on two multi-target and multi-marine-condition datasets confirmed that compared with other CNN-based methods that do not use GRL, GCIN can not only effectively alleviate the mismatch problem under marine conditions within given range, increase by 15% when the training set and test set are mismatched, but also improve the accuracy by at least 2.2% when two sets are matched.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00151","Research and Development; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407987","generalized channel-invariant feature;underwater target recognition;adversarial training;deep neural networks;gradient reverse layer","Training;Deep learning;Target recognition;Filtering;High performance computing;Noise reduction;Data models","deep learning (artificial intelligence);geophysical signal processing;gradient methods;marine engineering;oceanographic techniques;signal denoising;underwater sound","adversarial training;multimarine-condition datasets;underwater target recognition;complex marine conditions;deep learning;marine background noise;transmission channels;speaker recognition;channel compensation;generalized channel-invariant network;noise reduction;channel mismatch;domain adaptation;GCIN;gradient reversal layer;GRL;multitarget condition datasets","","","","19","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning has been successfully introduced into SpMT to improve its performance. An appropriate sample set is important for machine learning-based (ML-based) thread partition. Conventionally, heuristic rules-based (HR-based) sample generation approach can not generate adaptive samples, which conform to ML-based thread partition platform and characteristics of source applications. A hybrid sample generation approach is proposed. With this method, we firstly automatically generate samples which are mips codes consisting spawning points (SP) and control quasi-independent points (CQIP) by heuristic rules, then manually adjust the positions of SP and CQIP and rebuild pre-computation slice (p-slice) to obtain better performance for every application. During the implementation of this approach, three measures: bias weighting, reservation of optimal solutions, summary of greedy rules are carried out. In this way, we enhance the adjustment frequency for the subroutine with high called number, achieving a stable improvement of speedups. On Prophet, which is a generic SpMT processor to evaluate the performance of multithreaded programs, Olden benchmarks are used to realize the approach. Experiments show that the approach can obtain better sample sets, which deliver a better performance improvement of about 10% on a 32 core than conventional heuristic-based approach.

However, unlike recommending usual items, such as movies or music, event recommendation suffers from severe cold-start problem, because most events in EBSNs are typically short-lived and registered by only a few users. Additionally, the available feedbacks for events are implicit feedbacks. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Deep Neural Networks Collaborative Filtering Architecture (HDNN-CF) that collaboratively makes use of the events' semantic information and users' implicit feedbacks for event recommendation. Specifically, we extend state-of-the-art method AutoRec to model implicit feedbacks by proposing Probabilistic AutoRec (PAutoRec). We collaboratively train a Stacked Denoise AutoEncoder (SDAE) to learn the deep representation of the semantic information and a PAutoRec to collaborative filter based on implicit feedbacks. Extensive experiments on a real large scale dataset Meetup show that HDNN-CF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 10% on recall of top 30 recommendations.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397524","","Semantics;Collaboration;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Neural networks;Filtering;Adaptation models","collaborative filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;recommender systems;social networking (online)","HDNN-CF;hybrid deep neural networks collaborative filtering architecture;event recommendation;EBSNs;cold-start problem;available feedbacks;implicit feedbacks;events;users;Event-Based Social Networks;Probabilistic AutoRec;Stacked Denoise AutoEncoder;SDAE","","2","","27","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart city cyber systems carry critical data beginning with the simple sensor data captured by IoT devices up to and including providing the essential services and commands dependent upon that data. The broad reliance upon IoT in smart cities significantly increases the attack surface of the already large, complex, and heterogeneous smart city system by making each and every IoT device and its communications a potential entry point into the system. Our proposed framework utilizes Black Network protocols and key management to secure the most vulnerable, and typically unsecured, IoT communications. The framework utilizes a hierarchical, distributed architecture with pooled resources to prevent single points of failure and to sandbox attack impacts. This hierarchy allows AI enabled management tools to be placed both near the IoT edge using localized data and in the Big Data collections. Our analysis reveals that the proposed framework provides an adaptive health and security management framework that accounts for the dynamic, continuous, and ever-changing life in a smart city.","","978-1-7281-8420-3","10.1109/GCAIoT51063.2020.9345912","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345912","","Protocols;Smart cities;Security management;Tools;Internet of Things;Artificial intelligence;Cyberattack","","","","6","","38","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Monitoring the QoE (Quality of Experience) of video can help them to improve their service. However, most of the video traffic is encrypted traffic which has unreadable payload and less information in the transport layer that makes monitoring QoE a challenging task. QoE is measured from multiple metrics and many methods have been proposed to infer it. Traditional machine learning based methods have two main shortcomings. 1) These methods ignore the relevance of these metrics which can do a favor to the inference of QoE. 2) They need to extract the transport layer features and statistic features manually. In this paper, we propose multi-task learning with hierarchy (MTLH) model for inferring video QoE metrics. We use shared layer to extract deep features automatically from traffic tendency pictures which reveal the variation tendency of video streaming, that characterizes video QoE. In addition, we utilize the hierarchy to promote fine-grained start-up delay tasks. Finally, we use multitask learning architecture to learn the correlation between each task and use their correlation to refer QoE metrics. We evaluate our model for YouTube adaptive video streams on two datasets. The proposed approach achieved an average 9.0% higher of precision score and an average 11.5% higher of recall score than the state-of-the-art method in two datasets.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00054","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407941","QoE;Multi-Task Learning;CNN;Hierarchy;Encrypted Traffic","Measurement;Correlation;Streaming media;Feature extraction;Delays;Quality of experience;Cryptography","cryptography;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of experience;social networking (online);telecommunication traffic;video streaming","video streaming;fine-grained start-up delay tasks;multitask learning architecture;YouTube adaptive video streams;MTLH;video QoE monitoring;encrypted traffic;video traffic;content providers;high-quality service;Quality of Experience;transport layer features;statistic features;hierarchy model;video QoE metrics;deep features;traffic tendency pictures;machine learning based methods;multitask learning with hierarchy","","","","28","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CTG is frequently used for assisting the obstetricians to obtain detailed physiological information of fetal and pregnant woman as a technique of diagnosing fetal well-being. However, the visual analysis of the CTG traces requires a high level of expertise of the obstetricians and can cause inter- and intra-observer variability. Therefore, this research aimed at realizing a clinical decision support system for diagnosing fetal risk through advanced machine learning method applied to relevant features extracted from CTG recordings. In this paper, a CTG dataset consisting of 2126 recordings and 21 features obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository is used for classification. After selecting more relevant features from total features based on Principle Component Analysis (PCA), data are trained and tested through Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm integrated with Support Vector Machine (SVM) to obtain a strong classifier for classifying the unknown CTG data and predicting the fetal state. Fetal state is divided into two classes as normal and pathological. Based on ten-fold cross-validation, according to the results of this study, a good overall classification accuracy of total and selected features using AdaBoost approach were obtained as 93.0% and 98.6%, computation time of 11.6s and 2.4s, respectively. So this research shows the success of hybrid PCA and AdaBoost for classifying CTG data and assessing fetal state. Furthermore, some criterias of classification performance measure were taken into consideration, including sensitivity, specificity, AUC, etc.","","978-1-5386-1937-7","10.1109/CISP-BMEI.2017.8302314","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8302314","Fetal State Assessment;Cardiotocography;feature selection;PCA;AdaBoost;SVM","Fetal heart rate;Principal component analysis;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms;Histograms;Training;Support vector machines","cardiology;decision support systems;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;medical signal processing;obstetrics;patient monitoring;pattern classification;principal component analysis;support vector machines","fetal state assessment;cardiotocography parameters;obstetricians;pregnant woman;visual analysis;intra-observer variability;clinical decision support system;CTG dataset;UCI Machine Learning Repository;Principle Component Analysis;Adaptive Boosting algorithm;Support Vector Machine;AdaBoost approach;hybrid PCA;FHR;fetal heart rate signal;uterine contraction;UC;feature extraction;SVM;classifier;ten-fold cross-validation;feature selection","","27","","14","IEEE","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We explore gravitational, elastic and Coulombic models, both with global and local energy minimization, finding that the Coulombic model obtains the most efficient solution.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397418","agile code;physical models","Computational modeling;Task analysis;Data models;Potential energy;Distributed databases;Force;Minimization","data analysis;distributed processing;graph theory;minimisation","atomistic simulations;ACAD problem;particles-on-a-graph model;data analytics;gravitational Coulombic models;elastic Coulombic models;physics-inspired models;federated edges;instantiating computing tasks;distributed edge systems;agile data;potential energy models;agile code;global energy minimization;local energy minimization","","1","","7","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Review on Intelligent Internal Attacks Detection in VANET","R. N.

With the recent advances in technology and development of smart cities information security is crucial because of the nature of information shared across these networks. The main challenge facing VANET is information security. Nodes can be attacked from inside the network or outside. Insider attacks are attacks from authentic members of the network while outsider attacks are those from non-authentic members. This is even made more difficult considering the VANET characteristics like high mobility nodes, limitation to road network, dynamic network topology and the large scale of the network. To deal with these attackers methods such as Cryptography and trust are used. Trust establishment in VANET helps deal with insider attacks, although most of the existing solutions assume the attacker will always show a stable dishonest behavior over time, which is not the case with intelligent insider attackers, they exhibit intelligent behaviors to avoid detection. In this Paper we review existing solutions used in misbehavior detection with primary concern on intelligent attacks like the adaptive detection threshold, evaluation of trust among vehicles for independent time periods and draw conclusions, as well as give suggestions on future research to mitigate intelligent attacks.","","978-1-5386-6956-3","10.1109/ICNISC.2018.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8842995","VANET;misbehavior detection;intelligent attacks;trust","Vehicular ad hoc networks;Estimation;Trust management;Delay effects;Delays","cryptography;intelligent sensors;smart cities;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;vehicular ad hoc networks","adaptive detection threshold;traffic safety;road events;hazards;nonauthentic members;VANET characteristics;road network;dynamic network topology;vehicular ad-hoc networks;intelligent insider attacker behavior methods;smart city information security;intelligent internal attack detection;value added service;cryptography;trust establishment","","","","27","IEEE","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to Asian examples of newly growing smart cities, usage of technology can improve life standard and reduce cost of living, improve operational efficiency, environmental sustainability, eco-friendly infrastructure, smart technology Internet of Things (IoT), smart living and direct citizen participation in decision making process. Learning, adaptation and innovation could be the future for Croatian cities by using all mentioned, which will improve social, regulatory and safety indicators for designing a better living environment for Croatian citizens. While using Public Private Partnership (PPP) models, crowdsourcing and democratic ecologies which provide better and more efficient public services by taking advantage of private sector's “know-how”, cities will create long-term investment opportunities and sustain real time optimization strategies by providing safe and reliable place to invest. The intention of this paper is to show how the (local) government's role in PPP projects is to evaluate and approve detailed execution plans of the concessionaire while the private partner's role is to design, build, finance, and operate the facilities. In futuro, digital technologies offer numerous possibilities for citizen participation in decision making at local and regional government level.","","978-953-233-090-8","10.23919/MIPRO.2017.7973643","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7973643","Internet of Things;smart city;Public Private Partnership;concession models;public procurement;decision making","Smart cities;Government;Europe;Biological system modeling;Sociology;Statistics","crowdsourcing;decision making;ecology;economic indicators;environmental factors;Internet of Things;organisational aspects;public administration;safety;smart cities","public private partnership;smart cities;Croatia;life standard;cost of living;environmental sustainability;eco-friendly infrastructure;smart technology;Internet of Things;IoT;smart living;decision making;social indicators;regulatory indicators;safety indicators;PPP models;crowdsourcing;democratic ecologies;government","","6","","28","","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moving towards the implementation of the functional architecture, it is important to be aware of the information to be exchanged and how communication protocols can be used in support of Smart Grid information exchange. Therefore, a reference method needs to be developed for assessing and classifying the ICT interoperability standards and specifications. The existing Common Assessment Method for Standards and Specifications (CAMSS) is thought to be a tool for Public Administration choices of standards, especially for e-government and e-procurement in EU. Despite CAMSS defines an evaluation schema for standards and specifications via an Excel tool, this paper shows that the CAMSS approach needs to be modified and adapted for the goals of ELECTRA IRP. Moreover, the elaborated tool would not only be useful for ELECTRA purposes but it would be used in a broader Smart Grid (SG) perspective as well and also, with some slight adaptations, more in general, for all complex contexts involving a high number of standards (e.g. the Smart City context).","","978-1-4799-7736-9","10.1109/SEDST.2015.7315228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7315228","SGAM;information layer;communication layer;CAMSS;standard assessment;Smart Grids;standards","Standards;Smart grids;Interoperability;Europe;Context;Testing","open systems;power engineering computing;smart power grids","unified classification and evaluation approach;SG interface standards;ELECTRA IRP;smart grid information exchange;ICT interoperability standards;common assessment method for standards and specification;e-government;e-procurement;EU;CAMSS approach","","2","","15","IEEE","5 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research developed for the project SCUOLA - Smart Campus as Urban Open LAbs introduced the idea of creating an app to include the users' feedback into the information chain of a pilot smart building. The paper describes the early-stage of implementation and evolution of this concept, which define a dialogue between building and users, by realizing a bi-directional interaction via a newly developed mobile application. The app - Smart Campus UNIBS - mediates, as part of a complex system, between the two entities using the connectivity of Smart Living and the process of Data Analytics. The Smart Campus Demonstrator building at the University of Brescia, Italy, is equipped with sensors to monitor and control comfort, indoor air quality and HVAC parameters, such as hygro-thermal parameters, illuminance, CO2 and volatile organic compound (VOC), power of HVAC fans and environmental external factors. The sensors aim at providing data to develop adaptive, dynamic as well as predictive controls virtually incrementing the smartness of the building. The step further is to include the behavioral perspective linking the users to the previous framework. By exchanging different kinds of processed data, including BIM models, sensors and user feedbacks, it is possible to achieve an interaction between the built environment and the social landscape. The Smart Campus Demonstrator building integrates the smart concepts involved in the SCUOLA research project and beyond. It has been chosen to reveal the potential of such reciprocal interchange between humans and constructions towards the extended smart city. The overall purpose is ultimately that of creating a prototype for adaptive systems in architecture i.e. “Cognitive Buildings” which can learn by users' behavior.","","978-1-5090-1846-8","10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580819","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7580819","bi-directional app;users-responsive building;behavioral servitization;cognitive building;smart cities","Internet of things;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Smart cities;Bidirectional control","home automation;HVAC;mobile computing;smart phones","smart city;SCUOLA research project;social landscape;BIM models;predictive controls;CO2;HVAC fans;VOC;volatile organic compound;hygro-thermal parameters;HVAC parameters;Italy;University of Brescia;smart campus demonstrator building;smart campus UNIBS;user feedback;smart campus as urban open labs;smart devices;mobile service;smartphone app;cognitive buildings;bi-directional interactions","","16","","26","IEEE","3 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The algorithm is a low collision wireless protocol, which is suitable for data collection systems such as intelligent street lighting, smart meters and smart appliances. In the algorithm some unstable status may be occurred due to the environmental interference and the inappropriate design of the protocol. In this paper, we proposed a rescuing algorithm for link-list wireless network with wormhole mechanism to overcome some problems in the link-list network, such as the node losing problem, the path-optimized construction problem and the acknowledge packet confliction problem. We use the network simulation-3 to verify the efficacy of the rescuing algorithm. The results prove that the recuing algorithm can solve the routing problem of the link-list network and help the link-list network to transfer the data quickly.

However, there are ongoing issues like architecture design, hardware design, cost accountability, identity, privacy, and security issues for building new services and solutions in IoT. To resolve these issues, we can categorize them either as business-driven or research driven. Some of the research driven issues are architecture design, identity, privacy, and security. In this survey, we primarily focus on the architecture design, identity, privacy, and security issues associated with IoT. After a brief introduction on the adaptation of IoT in recent times, we discuss various architectures currently available for IoT along with the issues in identity, security and privacy.

This solution, based on BatNET wireless communication technology, has been installed worldwide at 16 factories dedicated to the manufacture of steel and aluminum parts for the automotive industry. BatNET is built on open and standard protocols and it was initially envisaged for building and Smart City applications. Some adaptations in hardware, firmware and software have been required to fulfil the industrial harsh environment.

Consider for instance the case of smart cities and communities, i.e., communities of people who actively participate to the creation and use of ICT-based solutions to improve their quality of life within their own city or region. Within a smart city and community, the context in which applications must operate continuously changes, as well as the situation, the accessibility to (ICT-based) services, the people, their interactions, requirements, and preferences. Moreover, most often, the only way applications can react to such changing environment is at run-time, since we cannot predict a priori different situations, requirements, interactions, and availability of (ICT) services. Continuous context-aware and incremental adaptation becomes therefore the key enabling property for the delivery of ICT based value added services to cope with the dynamics of the continuously changing environment. In my talk, I will present some of the compelling needs for context aware incremental adaptation in the case of service-based applications for smart cities and communities. I will discuss some alternative approaches, some lessons learned from applications we have been working with in this field, and the still many related open research challenges.","","978-9-8975-8134-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7297934","","","","","","","","","","15 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
