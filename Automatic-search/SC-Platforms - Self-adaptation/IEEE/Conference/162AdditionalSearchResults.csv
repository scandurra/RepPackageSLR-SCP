In order to improve efficiency, computing tasks such as object detection are carried out on the drone-mounted computing unit. However, there is a trade-off between flight altitude and mission accuracy. Higher altitudes result in smaller images, which influence the accuracy. In comparison, shorter altitudes reduce the difficulty of detection while decreasing the recognition range, which affects user experience. Therefore, this paper proposes an airborne altitude adaptive UAV System, Aprus, which selects the most suitable object detection models based on a self-adaptation strategy at different altitudes. The selection strategy is based on a purpose-related evaluation indicator, PEI. It comprehensively considers the model's accuracy, recall, and inference speed at the current altitude according to the user's purpose. Moreover, Aprus sends the original image to a divider instead of scaling the image before pushing it to the model, thus ensuring that the original picture information will not be lost. To evaluate the system, we build a high-resolution UAV dataset with altitude, UDWA, which contains 46037 images. From the experiments, Aprus obtained 58.52% mAP, 94.17%mAP50, 66.17%mAR, 1.61FPS results on DJI Manifold 2G when the purpose is set to Balance mode, and the system can be adjusted by multiple preset purposes or according to the user customs.",,979-8-3503-1993-4,10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00083,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62162067,62101480); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2021M693227); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074645,Altitude adaptive;Purpose related;Object detection;UAV system;Edge Computing;Embedded system,Meters;Manifolds;Adaptation models;Image resolution;Atmospheric modeling;Object detection;Autonomous aerial vehicles,autonomous aerial vehicles;deep learning (artificial intelligence);disasters;geophysical image processing;image fusion;image resolution;image sampling;object detection;remotely operated vehicles;video signal processing,airborne altitude adaptive;airborne altitude-adaptive purpose-related UAV System;Aprus;current altitude;disaster relief;edge scenarios;high-resolution UAV dataset;higher altitudes;mission accuracy;multiple preset purposes;purpose-related evaluation indicator;selection strategy;self-adaptation strategy;shorter altitudes;situational awareness;smaller images;suitable object detection models;trade-off between flight altitude;unmanned aerial vehicle system;user experience,,,,40,IEEE,28-Mar-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

It is difficult to build a high-accuracy instantaneous CPU/DRAM power prediction model. One of the main reasons for the low accuracy is that the processor architecture sometimes influence greatly on the accuracy of power prediction. For example, the accuracy of processor power model is affected by inaccurate modeling of the uncore part of processor. Another reason comes from the limitation of static models for instantaneous power prediction. Despite the existence of various optional linear/nonlinear models, the fixed training set and model coefficients are insufficient to make high-accuracy instantaneous predictions for various target programs. Aiming at the above two issues, this paper proposes an Adaptive Power Prediction framework based on spatial Partition multi-phase model ($AP^{3}$). Spatial partition mainly solves the impact of uncore power on the prediction accuracy, and adaptability solves the limitation of the static model on the power prediction accuracy. According to the experimental results on both ARM-based and x86-based processor platforms, $AP^{3}$ greatly increases the CPU and DRAM power instantaneous prediction accuracy.

It is able to effectively isolate endpoint congestion when facing adversary hot-spot and bursty traffic, and achieve dynamic load-balancing and mitigate network congestion when meeting heavy uniform traffic. We utilize state-of-the-art high-performance interconnection benchmark, GPCNeT, as traffic generators to generate rich network congestion workloads and thus enhance online-training efficiency of RELAR. We conduct extensive experiments against state-of-the-art routing algorithms to evaluate our design. The results show that RELAR achieves 14.82% and 9.86% reduction in packet latency on average, and reduces packet latency by up to 34.24% and 16.82% under heavy synthetic traffic workload and high-performance interconnection benchmark, respectively. We also perform cost analysis to validate potential implementation of RELAR on NoCs with low computation, storage and power.",,978-1-6654-9457-1,10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00069,NUDT; National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0204300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62002368); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781172,reinforcement learning;adaptive routing;network-on-chips,Adaptive systems;Heuristic algorithms;Reinforcement learning;Computer architecture;Traffic control;Benchmark testing;Routing,learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems;network routing;network-on-chip;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic,network-on-chips;many-core architecture exhibit;time-varying traffic patterns;witnessing most existing heuristic adaptive routing algorithms;multiobjective optimization;complex traffic;network behaviors;reinforcement learning methods;architecture design exploration;adaptive routing design;comprehensive reinforcement learning framework;RELAR;diversified traffic patterns;bursty traffic;mitigate network congestion;heavy uniform traffic;state-of-the-art high-performance interconnection benchmark;traffic generators;rich network congestion workloads;state-of-the-art routing algorithms;heavy synthetic traffic workload,,,,27,IEEE,30-May-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Nevertheless, the huge storage and computational costs of high-performance models severely limit their deployment on resource-limited embedded devices. Knowledge distillation (KD) is the mainstream approach for models compression, but the existing KD framework has some limitations. First, the student model underperforms when there is a considerable capacity gap between the student and teacher models, which reduces the model compression rate in knowledge distillation. Second, compared with training from scratch, the billions of additional forward propagation of the complex teacher model is time-consuming, resulting longer train time in the distillation process. This paper proposes AKD, an efficient difference-adaptive knowledge distillation framework. AKD consists of two modules. The distillation module uses a modified auxiliary teaching architecture as the backbone, and the adaptive module introduces a difference-adaptive method, which can adjust the teacher model adaptively according to the continuously improving representation ability of the student model.

Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the most typical distributed big data architecture, which has the characteristics of high reliability, high fault tolerance, and low hardware cost. HDFS provides the efficient task implementation and fault tolerance among nodes by Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism.

This method can be used to reduce the networking traffic and processing pressure of NameNode nodes, and improve the I/O and task performance.

Existing approaches either require paper-and-pen reporting of visitors to venue managers, causing human-to-human transmission risk, or collecting sensitive data about visitors to generate one-time health codes, causing serious privacy breaches. In this work, we design a contactless check-in system with anonymous visitor self-reporting, and propose an adaptive venue access control mechanism that takes into consideration both the visitor’s liability and the venue’s availability to prevent in-venue cluster infection. Specifically, our method can not only assess the visitor’s liability from their self-reported information (e.g., residence, traveling, and symptoms) using radar map analysis, but also evaluate the situation of the venue by quantifying the risk of overload against social distancing. A graph database is then employed to store check-in records between visitors and venues, which brings great performance improvement for data storage and analysis.

The future generation of traffic systems in a connected world will offer a thorough traffic information framework to support all modes of transportation, including cars, public transportation, ambulances, containers, trucks, bicycles, and pedestrians. Existing detection systems provide fundamental information such as vehicle count, occupancy, and transit data. Contemporary traffic control management systems allow one to keep an eye on signal operations, update signal controls and plans based on the time of day or traffic volume, and even provide adaptive signal timing, which modifies signal timing parameters based on traditional car detector data.

There is an increasing demand for maximum network bandwidth and high-availability communications as smart transportation systems, connected vehicle technologies, and autonomous vehicles approach. To correctly estimate the phase of a particular signal, information on vehicle presence, vehicle count, and delay time is gathered. The amount of time a vehicle must wait before moving on following an assault can be used to gauge its importance. The model will utilise the SUMO data on vehicle presence to decide which signal phase to send as an output in order to reduce the cumulative time delay for automobiles at any given instant. The reinforcement algorithm will decide if the output has produced a desirable situation and will deliver arbitrary rewards as output.

Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a feasible paradigm to control decentralized systems. In this work, we design a recurrent communication module for traffic light control systems. Aiming at lightweight decentralized learning, we decouple the interaction among entities, using an improved recurrent neural network to share messages. Regarding traffic lights as a partially observable Markov Decision Process, we develop a complete reinforcement learning model.

According to the characteristics of different network traffic to ensure the full utilization of broadband resources and improve the quality of network service. Due to the wide application of dynamic port number and stream encryption technology, the traditional network traffic classification method based on port number and deep packet inspection is no longer effective. In recent years, machine learning methods can be used to accurately identify categories of network traffic applications by labeled data. However, collecting enough labeled network traffic data is a time-consuming and difficult task, and the distribution of traffic data collected in various networks is different. In order to solve the problem of insufficient labeled samples and domain distribution differences, a network traffic classification method based on domain adaptive migration is proposed in this paper. This paper designs a new domain adaptive method, which reduces distribution differences between domains, makes the distribution of samples under the same category more compact and different application categories more separated. Then migrate the feature extraction module to the target domain.

In order to ensure the desired reliability in a time-varying channel, link adaptation is required. Therefore, the current and upcoming technologies use adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) schemes. By using AM C, the reliability and data rates could be adapted according to the channel conditions. To further improve reliability, concepts like multi-connectivity could also be used. In multi-connectivity, redundant data can be transmitted using multiple simultaneous links and combined at the receiver to improve reliability. However, this requires link adaption in terms of both numbers of multiple links and AMC. In this paper, we evaluate different link adaptation schemes for IEEE 802.11bd based on single-link and multi-connectivity communications. For single-link communications, we generate channel quality indicators (CQI) based on various signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) mapping techniques, e.g., exponential effective SINR mapping (EESM), received bit information rate (RBIR), and recently proposed enhanced EESM (eEESM). The performance of these schemes is evaluated in terms of achieved reliability and data rates. Results show that eEESM achieves close to optimal performance.

As a large-scale flexible load, district cooling system (DCS) is an ideal resource to suppress short-time tie-line power fluctuations through load control. However, the real-time control for DCS is quite challenging due to the following two reasons: i) DCS is commonly a complex thermal system that is hard to be modeled accurately, so that most model-based control methods cannot work for it; ii) Uncertainties from the REN’s power fluctuations make it difficult to achieve zero-steady control results. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a model-free reinforcement learning method for DCS, which can obtain an adaptive control strategy to smooth tie-line power.

However, it is challenging to handle poor illumination and indiscernible information. To tackle these problems, a saliency-guided domain adaptation network, SGDA, is proposed via adapting daytime models to nighttime scenes. Firstly, a saliency guidance branch is attached to the segmentation network to enrich the spatial features and guide the model to better perceive detail information. Secondly, to embed the saliency guidance to the segmentation network, a pyramid attention architecture is designed to fuse the features from the two branches. Thirdly, an illumination adaptation module is constructed to close the intensity distributions via adversarial learning, with an elaborately designed loss function to improve the performance. Extensive experiments on Dark Zurich dataset and Nighttime Driving dataset validate the effectiveness of SGDA, and indicate that our method improves the accuracy on small object categories,",2769-3899,979-8-3503-1125-9,10.1109/ICPS58381.2023.10128083,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10128083,Nighttime semantic segmentation;deep learning;smart city,Adaptation models;Fuses;Smart cities;Semantic segmentation;Semantics;Lighting;Cyber-physical systems,image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;smart cities,illumination adaptation module;Nighttime Driving dataset validate;nighttime scenes;Nighttime semantic segmentation;saliency guidance branch;saliency-guided domain adaptation network;segmentation network;SGDA,,,,46,IEEE,24-May-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Specifically, three vehicle powertrains are considered in this study, including internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The integrated controller simultaneously computes energy-optimal routings and energy-optimized trajectories in the vicinity of signalized intersections. A simulated traffic network in the Greater Los Angeles Area is used to implement and test the integrated controller. The test results demonstrate that the integrated controller produces fuel/energy consumption savings, reduces vehicle travel time and delays in urban networks. We also conducted tests to compare the integrated controller to multi-objective eco-routing. The test results for BEVs indicate that the integrated controller effectively reduces energy consumption by up to 8.8% and stopped delay by up to 50%, but increases travel time by up to 28% and total delay by up to 43.8%, compared to the multi-objective eco-routing base case.

However, the use of the Shannon expression, i.e., bandwidth times the logarithm of unity plus the signal to noise ratio (SNR), is challenged in intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) VLC channel. In this paper, we overview some literature on capacity bounds and achievable rates of VLC. We classify the Shannon capacity as the upper bound for VLC with optical or electrical power constraints. A tight closed-form lower bound can be also derived with the peak optical power, average optical power and electrical power constraints. Moreover, with a specific modulation, the achievable rate can be derived by inverting the bit error rate (BER) error function to obtain the SNR needed to carry a certain constellation with for instance one-dimension pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) or two-dimension quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) at an adequate BER or symbol error rate (SER). These yield Shannon-like expressions for the achievable rates, but with a correction factor for the SNR which is a function of the required uncoded BER. Since QAM is commonly utilized in each subcarrier of multi-carrier orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), this suggests the achievable rates of QAM can be extended for the throughput calculation of DC-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM). Numerical results indicate a gap between the lower bound and the achievable rates by the PAM and DCO-OFDM signaling, which means that neither PAM nor DCO-OFDM is the optimal modulation scheme for VLC channels and other capacity-achieving modulations can be further explored.",,979-8-3503-1993-4,10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00273,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074767,VLC;Capacity;Achievable rates;PAM;OFDM,AWGN channels;Upper bound;Quadrature amplitude modulation;OFDM;Bit error rate;Throughput;Adaptive optics,AWGN;AWGN channels;error statistics;free-space optical communication;intensity modulation;OFDM modulation;optical modulation;pulse amplitude modulation;quadrature amplitude modulation;smart cities,achievable rate;additive white Gaussian noise;average optical power;bit error rate error function;capacity bounds;capacity-achieving modulations;DC-biased optical OFDM;DCO-OFDM;direct detection VLC channel;electrical power constraints;peak optical power;power-limited linear time-invariant channel;Shannoncapacity;Shannonexpression;SNR;symbol error rate;two-dimension quadrature amplitude modulation;visible light communications;VLC channels;yield Shannonlike expressions,,,,14,IEEE,28-Mar-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The DSS architecture is developed based on Markov Decision Process (MDP) and it reinforces the model-based CPS management system in making optimal decisions by taking into account a wide range of disruptive scenarios existing in CPS operation. In the event of a disruption, an initial decision is chosen randomly, and then it is optimized gradually over time by transiting to new states and finding decisions with higher reward values. Two factors are considered for determining immediate rewards in the support system: execution time and cost of the decision. The proposed decision support system is applied to tackle disruptions (including fire hazard, power outage, pipe burst, appliance malfunction, natural disaster, and compromised network) in a smart building case study.

We use a sliding time window to scan the alarm data, and we exploit the matrix to record the corresponding results. According to the matrix, we calculate the support and confidence of association rules. Compared with other traditional association rule mining algorithms, the proposed algorithm does not need to set the minimum support artificially, and the obtained association rules have strong causality. Through extensive experiments on syn-thetic and real OTN alarm datasets, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and the correctness of the obtained association rules.",,979-8-3503-1993-4,10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00157,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074640,data mining;time series;association rules,Optical interconnections;Statistical analysis;Redundancy;Optical fiber networks;Adaptive optics;Data mining;Optical devices,data mining;statistical analysis,alarm data;alarm information;mining alarm association rules;optical transmission network;OTN;OTN alarm datasets;sliding time window;statistical approach;statistics-based association rule mining algorithm,,,,12,IEEE,28-Mar-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Most of the existing research relies on a specific topology, or modification to the subnet inside a module. In this paper, we propose TCRing, a novel concentrated network-on-chip. TCRing is a bi-directional ring with only three routers, but has the ability to mount one or more nodes on each router. Despite the fact that TCRing has only one channel, there is no deadlock problem. In addition, TCRing's simple architecture is friendly to physical layout. However, the low-complexity design does not compromise the flexibility and scalability of TCRing. An irregular modular SoC based on TCRing is given as an example in this paper. Based on the Booksim2.0 simulator, TCRing has 33% lower latency and 50% higher throughput than traditional concentrated rings in uniform traffic patterns. Besides, TCRing consistently maintains low latency in neighbor and randperm traffic at any injection rates. TCRing is capable of dispersing congestion traffic by enabling adaptive routing. Excitingly, irregular TCRing performs better than regular topology, indicated that it is capable of dealing with complex application scenarios.

In this research, the pinwheels meant to serve as external cap to home chimney exhaust outlet is converted to vertical axis wind turbine, and the fluid-structure dynamism and generated output voltage when wind is at low and moderate speeds are investigated. The HCP-STEH unlike the large scale vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) or horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) generators is of very low inertia, which makes it to continue to spin effortlessly on rooftops at the slighted provocation of wind energy. This aerodynamic vorticity of the pinwheels is made to serve as source of mechanical vibration to a connected brush-less fan; which in this case is used as the electromagnetic converter (dynamo) meant to pump electromotive force (emf) through the set-up. In the setup, the dynamo is mechanically fastened to the pinwheels circular base through a harness, and the rotation of the pinwheels is transmitted to the dynamo by contact friction. In experiments, the HCP-STEH was investigated as a VIV set-up with low and moderate wind speeds. Results show that peak output voltage of 1. 31.7V was realised at no load, for a speed of between 7.05 and 7.4 km/hr., with tremendous increase in peak output voltage up to about 16V at around wind speed of 16 km/hr. The behaviour of the generated output voltage with wind speed was modeled and the model revealed a limiting output voltage of about 20V with much increased speed and minimum operational wind speed of about 6.8 km/hr. This becomes an energy harvester which can be powered by mechanical vibration of bluff-body using wind energy at 16 km/hr; which is the average wind speed of the environment in real life applications. This is sufficient to operate low power Internet of Things (IoT) nodes deployed around the city for environmental monitoring and autonomous purposes. Therefore, in this manner, pinwheels home-chimney exhaust ventilator caps are converted to ‘stand-alone’ low cost smart turbine energy harvesters, with no battery attached, and no grid connection, and they can be installed as attachments to IoT nodes or in close proximity to other points of consumption.",,978-1-6654-8445-9,10.1109/WPW54272.2022.9854030,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9854030,aerodynamic;Energy Harvesting (EH);induced emf;Internet of Things (IoT);pinwheels;smart city;vorticity;Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN),Vibrations;Wireless sensor networks;Costs;Wind energy;Wind speed;Voltage;Generators,aerodynamics;electric potential;energy harvesting;exhaust systems;fans;friction;Internet of Things;mechanical engineering computing;smart cities;vibrations;vortices;wind turbines,HCP-STEH;wind energy;pinwheels home-chimney exhaust ventilator caps;low cost smart turbine energy harvesters;smart city IoT;vortex-induced vibration;aerodynamic vorticity;electromagnetic converter;operational wind speed;VIV;electricity generation;fluid-structure dynamism;VAWT;HAWT;horizontal axis wind turbine generators;vertical axis wind turbine generators;brush-less fan;electromotive force;contact friction;Internet of Things;environmental monitoring;voltage 31.7 V;voltage 16.0 V;voltage 20.0 V,,1,,17,IEEE,17-Aug-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

While a wide range of VSR models is available with different processing capabilities and overhead, there is no consensus on the best model to use. This is because the optimal choice changes depending on the input video and the quality requirement. We present AssyVSR, an adaptive framework to dynamically choose the right VSR model to use from a model pool based on the input video and quality requirement. AssyVSR achieves this by using machine learning to build a model selector based on classification. Our classifier takes as input a set of numerical feature values of the input video and then predicts the best model to use for a given video resolution. The model is trained offline from training data, and the trained model can be applied to any unseen videos. AssyVSR further employs transfer learning to quickly update its model selector when the pool of candidate models changes without incurring significant training overhead. We evaluate AssyVSR by applying it to a representative mobile computation offloading environment using real hardware and over 3000 videos. Experimental results show that AssyVSR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model selection scheme and the SOTA super-resolution model by producing higher-quality videos and reducing the response time by over 60% when compared with the SOTA super-resolution model.",,979-8-3503-1993-4,10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00172,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074697,video super-resolution;model selection;transfer learning;performance optimisation,Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Superresolution;Transfer learning;Neural networks;Predictive models;Data models,computer vision;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;pattern classification;video signal processing,adaptive framework;adaptive model selection;AssyVSR;building VSR;candidate models changes;computer vision tasks;deep neural networks;different processing capabilities;given video resolution;higher-quality videos;input video;model pool;model selector;optimal choice changes;quality requirement;significant training overhead;SOTA super-resolution model;state-of-the-art model selection scheme;trained model;unseen videos;video super resolution;video super-resolution techniques;VSR model,,,,41,IEEE,28-Mar-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

As one of the most popular attractive directions, multi-view subspace clustering focuses on learning common subspace representations of different views that can reveal the underlying clustering structure of multi-view data. However, for learning more discriminative common subspace representations, current multi-view subspace clustering methods utilize pseudo labels of all samples to train the self-supervised model, which neglects the pseudo label noise problem in the self-supervised multi-view subspace clustering. To address the challenge, we propose a novel paradigm termed self-paced pseudo label refinement paradigm, which aims at dynamically refining pseudo labels in the self-supervised multi-view subspace clustering. First, we design the self-paced learning strategy to prevent noisy pseudo labels from interfering with the self-supervised model training and improve the discrimination of view-specific semantic features. Then, we develop the adaptive update mechanism to learn weights of different views in an adaptive way and combine view-specific semantic features with obtained weights to refine pseudo labels.

On the other hand, this factor is used to mix the intermediate values of current and historical hidden state information. The aim that this process is to learn complex temporal information that changes over time.

The adaptive inertia weight adjustment strategy is proposed to optimize the weight distribution for kernel classifiers to match the changeable attack behaviors.

A computer vision technology is used for smart city real-time traffic monitoring, and a security camera can simultaneously record the license plate information of suspected vehicles.

Most complementary text detection and recognition methods are designed to identify text in images that are clear in the background and near-horizontal text.

Robots can achieve real-time incremental frontier detection when they are exploring unknown environments. First, our detector adaptively adjusts the sampling space of RRT by sensing the surrounding environment structure. The adaptive sampling space can greatly improve the successful sampling rate of RRT (the ratio of the number of samples successfully added to the RRT tree to the number of sampling attempts) according to the environment structure and control the expansion bias of the RRT. Second, by generating non-uniform distributed samples, our method also solves the over-sampling problem of RRT in the sliding windows, where uniform random sampling causes over-sampling in the overlap area between two adjacent sliding windows. In this way, our detector is more inclined to sample in the latest explored area, which improves the efficiency of frontier detection and achieves incremental detection.

As an enabling technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) must facilitate several advanced applications with varied QoS requirements for smart cities. In this regard, Long Range (LoRa) technologies can be an ideal communication protocol for resource-constrained IoT devices. The LoRa Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) defines physical layer options and the medium access control (MAC) sub-layer protocols for facilitating low-power, low-rate communications among battery-operated wireless IoT devices. With the enormous number of IoT devices and growing QoS requirements, it is imperative to optimally allocate resources (bandwidth, spreading factor, and transmit power) to these constrained devices so that network lifetime can be improved. The Adaptive Data-Rate (ADR) technique is used by the Network Servers (NS) to adapt the transmission parameters of the devices optimally. This is based on several received parameters from the end devices as well as the network settings. In this work, we extend the ADR technique to the LoRa gateways to consider the class of LoRa devices and the frequency of transmissions further to extend the energy efficiency and lifespan of IoT devices. Additionally, there is a considerable delay in adapting to optimal settings for the end-devices resulting in excess power dissipation.

Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents’ quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people’s lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it’s aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we’ll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we’ll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We’ll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, “home operating system” featuring life-long learning of users’ dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents’ lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities. By adopting a closed feedback loop, dynamic adaptiveness, and interactive human involvement, the UV Smart Home system aims to be a highly automated, intelligent, and human-controllable system. It leverages machine learning techniques and user feedback to continually update its knowledge base and adapt to changing lifestyles.

Firstly, the channel power spectrum envelope is used to determine the distribution bands and size of noise. Then each band is labeled as an exponential power of its multiple based on the benchmark of the minimum power spectrum, which achieves an adaptive labeling of the whole spectrum. Finally, for different spectral environments, the adjustment factor is introduced into the label spectrum to change the convergence rate of interference suppression according to the spectral conditions. The results show that compared with the optimal single threshold method, this method reduces the bit error rate to less than 0.1 times, increases the spectral occupancy by 20%, and has less computational complexity when the number of sample points of the amplitude spectrum is large.

To break this limitation, the gradient compression algorithms employ the ultimate compression ratio at the expense of the accuracy of the trained model. Therefore, new gradient compression techniques are necessary to ensure both communication efficiency and model accuracy. This paper introduced a novel technique - an Adaptive Sparse Ternary Gradient Compression (ASTC) scheme to enhance the communication efficiency and training accuracy during the DNN training. Specifically, ASTC firstly establishes the model compression selection criterion by the amount of gradients to compress the network layer that meets the criterion. Secondly, ASTC evaluates the gradients' importance based on entropy to adaptively perform sparse compression. Finally, ASTC performs ternary quantization compression and a lossless code scheme to further reduce the communication cost. Numerical results demonstrate that the average iteration time of ASTC can be reduced largely compared to the state-of-art benchmark schemes.

Firstly, AFQELC analyzes the statistical characteristics of the image and constructs a local contrast adaptive filter (LCAF) to enhance the detailed information of the image, which promotes the deep learning model to learn low-level semantic information. Secondly, principal component analysis (PCA) fusion combines information from the original image and the image enhanced by LCAF to reduce noise. Finally, the gradient component of the original image is extracted to further revise the processing result, which promotes the deep learning model to learn advanced semantic information. The proposed non-data-driven algorithm has a clear and interpretable process, which is superior to other traditional and neural network based image enhancement algorithms.

Despite their superior performance, most existing studies focus datasets that are usually in large geographic scales, e.g., citywide, while ignoring the results on specific regions. However, in many scenarios, for example, route planning on time-dependent road networks, only small regions are of interest. We name the task of answering forecasting requests from any query region of interest (ROI) as ROI-demand traffic prediction (RTP). In this paper, we make a primary observation that existing methods fail to jointly achieve effectiveness and efficiency for RTP. To address this issue, a novel model-agnostic framework based on pre-Training, Querying and fine-Tuning, named TQT, is proposed, which first customizes input data given an ROI, and then makes fast adaptation from pre-trained traffic prediction backbone models by fine-tuning.

Deduplication packs multiple chunks into a large, fixed-size container as a storage unit to maintain the locality and achieve efficient compression. We observe that the traditional containers have low filling ratios due to a large amount of metadata generated by small files. Unfilled containers require more space to store a backup, which decreases the storage efficiency and reduces restore performance. In order to address this problem, we propose a Metadata region Adaptive Container Structure, called MACS. MACS maintains a tag to record the length of metadata region in the container. The boundary between meta-data region and data region is dynamically decided to ensure the maximum space efficiency of the containers. Moreover, we propose a container metadata length-based indexing and cache replacement strategy to allow MACS to be practical in data backup systems. We demonstrate the advantages of MACS with three real world backup datasets. MACS achieves over 95% average container filling ratio, which is significantly higher than existing designs.

Classical time-triggered protocols in wired networks, such as Ethernet, have been proven effective in supporting real-time and safety-critical communications. Along with the increasing use of wireless devices, designing wireless network protocols that handle the delivery of time sensitive activities becomes an important issue. Unlike the Time-Triggered Ethernet (TTE) protocol designed for wired networks, a time-triggered protocol tailored to wireless networks faces a number of barriers, such as unstable data transmission under high radio interference, high bit error rate, and limited computation and storage capabilities on IoT devices. In this paper, we introduce an Adaptive Time-Triggered Protocol (ATTP) for wireless networks. In particular, we design a dynamic repetition scheme that transmits replicated copies of one time-triggered data packet to ensure the reliability and low latency of data transmission. To minimize the overhead raised by the replication of packets, we dynamically select the necessary number of replicated copies according to the instantaneous quality of the connection link. To effectively utilize wireless resources, we also design a multi-class traffic scheduling scheme to handle three traffic types, time-triggered (TT) traffic that requires an absolute latency guarantee, event-triggered (ET) traffic that requires a relatively low latency guarantee, and best-effort (BE) traffic without any latency guarantee requirement. Via an extensive simulation study, we validate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving expected performance for time-triggered traffic with respect to latency, packet loss ratio, and overhead reduction.",,978-1-6654-1236-0,10.1109/SWC50871.2021.00091,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604398,Time-Triggered Protocols;Time Sensitive Traffic;Internet of Things,Wireless sensor networks;Technological innovation;Protocols;Adaptive systems;Smart cities;Wireless networks;Ethernet,Internet of Things;protocols;quality of service;radio networks;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic,time-triggered data packet;replicated copies;wireless resources;time-triggered traffic;event-triggered traffic;adaptive time-triggered protocol;wireless networks;time sensitive activities;classical time-triggered protocols;wired networks;wireless devices;wireless network protocols;Time-Triggered Ethernet protocol,,,,20,IEEE,18-Nov-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

The meta-data cached at the edge-cloud for real-time analytics and also continuously transferred to the cloud for data fusion and BigQuery batch processing. The proposed distributed deep learning search platform bridges the gap between edge-to-cloud continuum computation by utilizing state-of-the-art distributed deep learning and BigQuery search algorithms for the geo-distributed Visual Internet of Things (VIoT). We show that our proposed system supports real-time event-driven computing at 122 milliseconds on virtual IoT devices in parallel, and as low as 2.4 seconds batch query response time on multi-table JOIN and GROUP-BY aggregation.",,978-1-6654-9623-0,10.1109/SOSE55472.2022.9812698,National Science Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9812698,Adaptive metadata;cyber-physical hunting;deep neural networks;distributed AI-analytics;edge-to-cloud analytics;hierarchical re-identification;smart city;video analytics.,Deep learning;Visualization;Cloud computing;Smart cities;Image edge detection;Metadata;Cameras,cloud computing;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Internet of Things;query processing;search engines;sensor fusion;smart cities;video streaming;virtualisation,edge-to-cloud continuum computation;state-of-the-art distributed deep learning;BigQuery search algorithms;VIoT;real-time event-driven computing;virtual IoT devices;distributed AI-driven search engine;event discovery;connected devices;connected cameras;streaming videos;smart cities;deep neural networks;real-time video scene parsing;indexing;BigQuery retrieval;stored data;IoT video streams;adaptive meta-data;pretrained DNN;edge-cloud;real-time analytics;data fusion;edge visual Internet of Things devices;batch query response time;geo-distributed visual Internet;deep learning search platform,,,,20,IEEE,6-Jul-22,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In practice, the matrix sizes are usually too small to make full use of GPU resources in many applications. To this end, previous work has attempted to batch small GEMMs by designing a CUDA core to process multiple GEMMs simultaneously. It divides the GEMM into multiple tiles, and then process a tile in a thread block. However, the approach only processes one tile per thread block and allocates the number of thread blocks based on the size of the largest matrix in the batch. It will make some thread blocks and threads idle. In this paper, we propose a batching strategy to batch small GEMMs with the consideration of several factors, including tile number, block number, and block size. We process multiple tiles in a thread block. Different tiles may need different block size and block number, we select the optimal scheme adaptively according to the hardware resources occupancy. Our proposed strategy achieves the performance improvement of batched GEMM by improving GPU occupancy.

Chang,"Electrical Engineering Department, California State University, Long Beach; Spatial Digital Systems, Inc",2021 IEEE 7th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT),9-Nov-21,2021,,,930,934,"Many cities are adapting to new technology and advanced communication networks to update and improve infrastructure, such as public utilities, transportation, and other services. A green communication scheme using an orthogonal wavefront (WF) multiplexing scheme spatially combined with orthogonal frequency-division Multiple Access (OFDMA) techniques forms a spatial WF OFDMA transceiver. This WF OFDMA transceiver is proposed for smart city applications, including both fixed and mobile internet of things (IOT). The WF multiplexing and de- multiplexing technique serves as the preprocessing and postprocessing method of the transceiver. With coordinated multiple point forward transmission, this system establishes a communication network which can be applied to multiple access points (APs) with down links to a single mobile unit (MU) or multiple MUs either in mobile or stationary environment. These MUs can be IOT based mobile shopping systems, smart mobile services, mobile traffic controls, etc.}{Although signals received are non-coherently due to different distances between APs and MUs in a city, they can be compensated and coherently combined via adaptive equalizers at MUs periodically in a mobile environment. This is achieved by using pilot signals with an optimization method at the MU. Moreover, the required effective equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) from APs to the MUs is significantly reduced due to multiple non-coherent transmission. Accordingly, the interference to adjacent frequency bands’ signals will be low. This green communication network can also be applied to the MUs staying in a stationary environment with initial setting only on fixed equalizers at MUs.",,978-1-6654-4431-6,10.1109/WF-IoT51360.2021.9595249,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9595249,orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA);green communications;wavefront multiplexing;optimization,Smart cities;OFDM;Green products;Transportation;Optimization methods;Interference;Traffic control,adaptive equalisers;demultiplexing;frequency division multiple access;green computing;Internet of Things;mobile radio;multiplexing;OFDM modulation;optimisation;radio transceivers;radiofrequency interference;smart cities,advanced communication networks;public utilities;orthogonal wavefront multiplexing scheme;spatial WF OFDMA transceiver;orthogonal frequency-division multiple access techniques;mobile Internet of Things;demultiplexing technique;postprocessing method;coordinated multiple point;multiple access points;stationary environment;smart mobile services;mobile traffic controls;adaptive equalizers;mobile environment;green communication network;green communication systems;IOT-enabled smart cities;effective equivalent isotropically radiated power;fixed Internet of Things;single mobile unit;multiple MU;IoT based mobile shopping systems;optimization method;multiple noncoherent transmission;adjacent frequency band signal interference;fixed equalizers;WF multiplexing techniques;coordinated multiple point forward transmission;pilot signals,,,,33,IEEE,9-Nov-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Owing to the large amount of service requests from IoT devices attempting to access their communication networks from anywhere at any time, the requirement for dynamic and adaptive deployment of SFCs to accommodate dynamic changes in service requests is a major challenge today. In this paper, the dynamic deployment of hybrid SFCs in multi-domain edge cloud networks is addressed with the optimisation objective of minimising the total cost.

The annotation of mRNA sequence reactivity value is a time-consuming and labor-intensive work, which belongs to the private digital assets of each medical institution. It is not practical to train a predictive model by pooling private data from various parties. Fortunately, federated learning techniques can serve to collaboratively train a predictive model among medical institutions while preserving respective digital assets. However, due to the scarcity of data from each participant, conventional sequential prediction mod-els often fail to perform well. To overcome such a challenge, we propose a reactivity value prediction model based on both the self-attention and the convolutional attention mechanisms only requiring a small dataset of labeled samples. Inspired by BERT, we first train a self-attention feature extraction model through self-supervision using both labeled and unlabeled mRNA samples. In this way, the information of mRNA in the semantic space is deeply mined. Then, a convolutional attention block follows the self-attention block, to extract the attention matrix from the base-pair probability matrix and adjacency matrix. By doing so, the attention matrix can compensate for the insensitivity of the self-attention mechanism to the spatial information of mRNA. By using the Open Vaccine RNA database, experiments show that our prediction model for unseen mRNA has a better performance than other state-of-the-art deep learning models that are used to process gene sequences. Further ablation experiments demonstrate that the existence of the dual attention mechanism reduces the risk of overfitting, resulting in an excellent generalization capability of our model.",,979-8-3503-1993-4,10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00228,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072081,62072078,U2033212); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074723,Deep Learning;Attention Mechanism;Feder-ated Learning;Digital Assets,Deep learning;COVID-19;Adaptation models;Federated learning;RNA;Semantics;Predictive models,convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;epidemics;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;RNA,adjacency matrix;attention matrix;base reactivity;base-pair probability matrix;conventional sequential prediction mod-els;convolutional attention block;convolutional attention mechanisms;COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine reactivity;dual attention mechanism;federated learning scenarios;labeled mRNA samples;medical institution;mRNA sequence reactivity value;predictive model;private digital assets;reactivity value prediction model;respective digital assets;self-attention block;self-attention feature extraction model;self-attention mechanism;state-of-the-art deep learning models;unlabeled mRNA samples;unseen mRNA,,,,19,IEEE,28-Mar-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, such precision is insufficient for actual security requirements, especially when the image steganography payload is small. To further improve the precision for steganalysis, we propose a residual based CNN model with channel attention mechanism and an innovative pre-processing activation strategy that outperforms previous works in classification precision. Our CNN adopts SRM (Spatial Rich Models) to get rich features and utilizes depth wise separable convolution and Squeeze-and-Excitation attention module to build a CNN with residual structure.

A common practice is to leverage pseudolabels generated from a teacher model pretrained on benchmark datasets. However, such a teacher model may produce unreliable pseudolabels due to semantic shift from a standard domain to a novel domain. Blindly trusting pseudolabels may actually harm the target model's performance. To address this challenge, we propose a method to optimally adapt pseudolabels to work on a novel domain. At the center of our approach is a reliability score for pseudolabels that allows for an optimal mix of true labels and pseudolabels in training. Mirroring the standard practise of creating a benchmark dataset (such as ImageNet or GoEmotions), we use an ensemble of teacher models, instead of a single teacher model. Our reliability score captures both self-confidence of each teacher model and inter-model consistency among teacher models. This reliability score provides a disciplined way to balance the additional information in pseudolabels and the risk of overfitting incorrect labels. To test our approach for novel-domain object segmentation, we created an oil-leak surveillance dataset, which we have made publicly available.

However, the efficacy of such systems is determined by their ability to detect and track objects of interest from diverse viewpoints accurately. This is challenging due to the diverse viewpoints, elevations, and distinct properties of camera sensors. Thus, to ensure robust performance, the training dataset should cover many variations, including viewpoints, illumination changes, and diverse weather conditions. However, constructing such a dataset is expensive in terms of data collection and annotation. This paper proposes an unsupervised domain adaptation approach wherein a synthetic dataset is generated using a simulator and subsequently used to ensure performance consistency of multi-object-tracking (MOT) algorithms across a diverse range of manually annotated natural scenes. Towards this end, we emphasize achieving domain invariant object detection by combining image stylization and class-balancing augmentation. Furthermore, we extend the robust detection algorithm to track detected objects across a large time scale using feature embeddings generated by the detector.

Although many remarkable works attempted to solve the logistics scheduling problems, especially the logistics-related vehicle routing problem (VRP), most of them established the models based on Euclidean distance, which may result in suboptimal solutions due to the ignorance of road layout. That is, the optimal solution of the model may be suboptimal or even impractical when applied to the real-world situation because of the difference between the model and the real situation. To deal with this weakness, a VRP-based real traffic distance-aware logistics scheduling model that considers the road layout is established in this paper, where the real traffic distance is used as the input of the model. With the assistance of Baidu Map API, the real traffic distance between any two locations and the real traffic duration between them can be captured. In this way, a problem instance set with three scales (i.e., with 20, 30, and 40 locations) is built up for experiments. Besides, the ant colony system (ACS) is employed to solve the problem instances under the cases of using Euclidean distance, linear distance, and real traffic distance to measure the solutions.

Anomaly Detection for Reoccurring Concept Drift in Smart Environments,V. Agate; S. Drago; P. Ferraro; G. L.

Unfor-tunately, the statistical properties of the input data may change in unexpected ways. As a result, the definition of anomalous and normal data can vary over time and machine learning models may need to be re-trained incrementally. This problem is known as concept drift, and it has often been ignored by anomaly detection systems, resulting in significant performance degradation. In addition, the statistical distribution of past data often tends to repeat itself, and thus old learning models could be reused, avoiding costly retraining phases on new data, which would waste computational and energy resources. In this paper, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection system for streaming data in smart environments that accounts for concept drift and minimize the number of machine learning models that need to be retrained when shifts in incoming data distribution are detected. The system is multi-tier and relies on two different concept drift detection modules and an ensemble of anomaly detection models. An extensive experimental evaluation has been carried out, using two real datasets and a synthetic one; results show the high performance achieved by the system using common metrics such as F1-score and accuracy.",,978-1-6654-6457-4,10.1109/MSN57253.2022.00031,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076623,concept drift;smart city;online anomaly detection;unsupervised learning,Measurement;Adaptation models;Time-frequency analysis;Computational modeling;Statistical distributions;Machine learning;Data models,computer network security;data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;pattern classification,anomalous data;anomaly detection models;anomaly detection systems;costly retraining phases;crowdsensing applications today;data streams;different concept drift detection modules;hybrid anomaly detection system;incoming data distribution;learning algorithms;machine learning models;normal data;old learning models;smart environments;statistical distribution;statistical properties;unexpected ways,,,,36,IEEE,29-Mar-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

When the application scenario of reinforcement learning changes, or the application environment changes, the reinforcement learning model needs to be retrained. Thus, it is critical to design techniques that can reduce the overhead of retraining reinforcement learning models, enabling them adapt to constantly changing environments. In this paper, toward improving the performance of learning models in dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), we propose an online continuous reinforcement learning strategy. In our process, when the retraining condition is triggered, our online continuous learning strategy will re-engage the training process and update the well-trained model. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we categorize the entire application space for applying reinforcement learning to IIoT systems into four scenarios, namely, non-continuous learning without learning model sharing, non-continuous learning with learning model sharing, continuous learning without learning model sharing, and continuous learning without learning model sharing.

Edge devices, typically IoT objects, are characterized by limited computational capabilities, alongside high energy efficiency operations. In smart building or smart city applications, the overall amount of available IoT devices may account for an important computational capacity. Aggregating the idle CPU cycles of several devices would allow performing on-site parallel and distributed computing, while reusing the available resources in the network. Timely and important computational tasks such as video surveillance processing, HPC jobs, or deep neural network training, can be performed with local available resources. This includes local servers or a private, on-site cloud, as opposed to the use of public clouds, thus avoiding security issues and fostering energy efficiency. An ongoing research topic in such a distributed and volatile context is to design novel algorithms for resource provisioning that allow tasks to be distributed over a set of available IoT devices in an efficient manner. This work presents two online, adaptive and robust scheduling techniques, based on the UCB and EXP3 Multi-Armed Bandit algorithms (MABs), for resource management in Cloud-Edge Computing based environments while improving performance and reducing energy consumption.

The performance of the detection is particularly affected by environmental noise. To increase the performance of environmental sound (ES) recognition, different target features and masks are used in denoising, which has large differences in numerical range. However, as the number of targets with large numerical differences increases, the difficulty of network learning data rules will increase, and so will the target estimation error. The multi-objective learning noise suppression algorithm put forth in this paper aims to reduce the influence, based on a convolutional and dual temporal convolutional neural network (CNN-2TCN). The algorithm combines CNN and two parallel TCN modules to learn two types of targets with large differences in numerical range, which can optimize the training process of neural networks. In addition, the secondary targets and the IRM-based adaptive post-processing method are adopted to improve the prediction accuracy of primary targets and the quality of the reconstructed ES. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than other algorithms. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of the ES detection system.

Almost recent ALPR algorithms process on a single frame, which reduces accuracy in case of worse image quality. This paper presents methods to improve license plate recognition accuracy by tracking the license plate in multiple frames.
