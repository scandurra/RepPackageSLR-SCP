Smart government assessment using Scottish Smart City Maturity Model: A case study of Depok city,2017,"Nowadays, many cities around the world are moving towards the smart city by advancing the utilization of ICT and Depok is one of them. The Scottish Smart City Maturity Model, a smart city framework adapted from the IDC model and British Standard Institution PAS 181, can be used as a reference in determining the concept and direction of a smart city implementation. It identifies and measures the existing condition of a city in order to map the city's capabilities. Smart government, as a blend of technology and innovation, can be described as the next step for e-government. It is identified a vital part of the transformation towards smart city. Hence, this study aims to assess the maturity of the smart government in Depok City. This study adopts the Scottish Smart City Maturity Model using a qualitative approach that includes interviews, observations, and document analysis. This study also performs weigh calculation to determine the importance of the smart government dimension using the Entropy method. The results show that Depok is at level 1 (Ad-hoc) indicating that the city is still focusing on the development and application of ICT and on improving the use of data in its services.",10.1109/ICACSIS.2017.8355018
iQAS: An integration platform for QoI assessment as a service for smart cities,2016,"While reducing costs and improving sustainability, a common goal for Smart Cities is to become more “liveable” for their citizens. By taking advantage of new information sources offered by the Internet of Things (IoT), cities can rely on sensing platforms to improve their service offer. These sensing platforms, however, raise new research challenges, in particular regarding Quality of Information (QoI). To cope with this issue, common platforms generally provide quality-oriented internal mechanisms. Nevertheless, the configuration of such platforms is complex, especially for Smart City stakeholders that may have various skill levels and different areas of expertise. As a result, QoI assessment is often delegated to end applications where developers have to implement their own adaptation mechanisms. This paper proposes and describes iQAS, an integration platform for QoI Assessment as a Service for Smart Cities. iQAS is autonomic, extensible and configurable, allowing Smart City stakeholders to collaboratively assess and improve (when possible) QoI in real-time. While the platform development is at its early stages, we illustrate within a concrete case study the need for QoI assessment and the benefits to implement adaptation mechanisms.",10.1109/WF-IoT.2016.7845400
Data driven reference architecture for smart city ecosystems,2017,"With the convergence of information and telecommunication technologies, the vision of the `Smart City' is fast becoming a reality. City governments in a growing number of countries are capitalizing on these advances to enhance the lives of their citizens and to increase efficiency and sustainability. In this paper, we elaborate on smartCityRA, a reference architecture for Smart City projects, which serves as the design language for creating smart cities blueprints. Such a blueprint caters for diverse stakeholders, devices, platforms, and technologies. We report on our experience in carrying out a proof-of-concept use case with a major telecommunication provider in the UAE. In doing so, we refined our multiple-view model of the initial smartCityRA reference architecture. We show that Data in smart city applications drive the entire development lifecycle and should be considered early in the development cycle. In addition, Data affects all the other views in the smartCityRA and hence the Data View needs to be at the heart of the entire smartCityRA. Realizing the Data view using a component like a Data Hub helped in creating a central integration location for disparate data from different sources, thus reliving developers from dealing with several entities individually. Finally, we show that any smart city reference architecture, like smartCityRA, should be at the right level of abstraction to enable the flexibility of adoption and adaptation by different stakeholders and components.",10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397556
A smart city adaptive lighting system,2018,"This paper presents an urban smart lighting system capable to autonomously control the street lamp lighting level by exploiting data related to vehicles (bus, car, motorcycle and bike) and/or pedestrians traffic in a specific area. The system is able to set the lighting level on the basis of required needs and allows one to reduce energy costs. To this end, it makes use of local controllers, motion sensors, video-camera and electronic devices for video processing. In this way the inputs coming from the sensors is processed in order to optimally dim the lighting by applying an 1-10 V control input voltage to the fixture or driver. The control can be performed either on a decentralized fashion on each single street lamp or on a group of them. Experimental results show that with respect to a traditional street lamp system, the presented architecture allows energy saving up to 65%.",10.1109/FMEC.2018.8364076
A data lifeCycle model for smart cities,2016,"Smart Cities are the most challenging and promising technological solutions for absorbing the increasing pressure of population growth, while simultaneously enforcing a sustainable economic progress as well as a higher quality of life. Several technologies are involved in a potential Smart City deployment, although data are the fuel to achieve the demanded and mandatory smartness. Data can be obtained from multiple sources, in large quantities, and with a variety of formats, therefore, an appropriate management is critical for their effective usage. Data life cycle models constitute an effective trend towards developing an integral and efficient data management framework, from data creation to data consumption and removal. In this paper we present the Smart City Comprehensive Data LifeCycle (SCC-DLC) model, a data management architecture generated from a comprehensive scenario agnostic model, tailored for the particular scenario of Smart Cities. We define the management of each data life phase, and describe its implementation on a Smart City with Fog-to-Cloud (F2C) resources management, an architecture that combines the advantages of both cloud and fog strategies.",10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763506
Adaptive filtering as a service for smart city applications,2017,"Smart cities are a key factor in the consumption of materials and resources. As populations grow and resources become scarcer, the efficient usage of these limited goods becomes more important. Building on and integrating with a huge amount of data, the cities of the future are becoming a realization today. There are millions of sensors in place already, monitoring various things in metropolises. In the near future, these sensors will multiply until they can monitor everything from streetlights and trashcans to road conditions and energy consumption. In this context, effective strategies or solutions for refining data sets can play a key role. Based on these premises, we propose intelligent and adaptive filtering mechanisms as a service (FIlAAS) integrated in the VITAL-OS middleware and will show their feasibility and their effectiveness in the smart city context.",10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000147
A framework for transforming Dubai into a smart city,2017,"Smart City is a solution to the increased globalization of cities by managing and applying ICT to all the aspects of the city such as mobility, electricity, water, energy, economy, environment, governance, health, and education to increase the quality of life for city dwellers and the future sustainability. As people started to move from rural areas into cities, cities started to have congestion, traffic, crimes, increased carbon emissions, illiteracy, and unemployment. Cities have to manage these complexities by finding smart solutions. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has launched the strategy to transform Dubai into a smart city and to be ready for expo 2020 that could result in road traffic and increased tourism. Other reasons for Dubai to become a smart city are that are the business and real estate boom, because foreign investments are pouring in and many populations are coming to Dubai, so it needs to have sustainability. Dubai is in a state where it requires having sustainable energies and buildings to accept many populations. A framework is a set of principles and guidelines to prepare the right components and people, and taking the right steps and stages to achieve the outcomes. A roadmap is a vision done by stakeholders, of the final outcome of the desired project, and it takes from 10 to 50 years. A roadmap is a plan or strategy intended to achieve a particular goal. This research has studied various smart city initiatives in the world and the numerous frameworks on smart cities. An adaptive framework specifically for Dubai City has been proposed and a roadmap for its implementation has been suggested. This outcome can be used by the Government of Dubai to plan their smart city strategies.",10.1109/CTIT.2017.8259573
A meta-model for including social behavior and data into smart city management simulations,2015,"Smart city management can be regarded to bridge different realms of thinking about cities, i.e. 1) the city as complex-adaptive system, 2) socio-technical operational control center and 3) multi-actor policy-making. Underpinned by different world views and theoretical bodies, integration of the three realms puts forward new demands on simulation approaches and challenges current knowledge and available technology regarding integration of sub-models across different systems. In order to support urban transportation management, a holistic approach is needed that semantically connects the three realms by incorporation of human behavior and knowledge. Combining research on knowledge management and computer science, this paper presents a novel meta-framework as socio-technical hybrid simulation language to generalize integration of simulations, gaming and data for modeling urban transportation.",10.1109/WSC.2015.7408289
