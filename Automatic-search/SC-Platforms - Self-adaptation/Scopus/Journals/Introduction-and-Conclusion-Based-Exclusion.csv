Title,Abstract
Interoperability network model for traffic forecast and full electric vehicles power supply management within the smart city,Information technologies and applied mathematics provide us with a comprehensive framework to search for solutions to problems derived from traffic management.It is relevant for the mobility in our future cities to integrate the Full Electric Vehicle (FEV) in an interoperability network which allows us to track the FEV autonomy and to forecast the traffic and the power supply demand in the city. The target is to optimize the energy consumption and to improve the mobility in the city. To achieve these goals we propose an infrastructure to efficiently manage the power supply availability in the network of charge stations in the city and an adaptive model to predict the traffic based on historic data and on time series obtained mathematically. © 2019
Toward global IoT-enabled smart cities interworking using adaptive semantic adapter,"Since the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has been introduced, it is considered as one of the emerging technologies providing great opportunities to many vertical industries. One of the major IoT application areas that gets significant attention is smart city. Since it is unrealistic to expect full convergence toward a single IoT platform in the near future, it is mandatory to enable interworking between different platforms based on multiple standards, coexisting in the emerging smart cities. In this paper, we take the example of two global IoT standards, FIWARE and oneM2M, which are actively used in many smart city projects, and analyze them to show the feasibility of IoT platforms interworking. Based on the analysis, we design and implement a novel IoT interworking architecture providing a semantic driven integration framework suitable for smart city. The core idea behind our approach is to introduce interworking proxies that: 1) conduct a static mapping of sensor information between IoT platforms and 2) perform semantic interoperability using semantically annotated resources via a semantic interworking proxy that dynamically discovers new kinds of information and adapts itself to enable automatic translation of semantic data between given source and target IoT platforms while it is running. We present the system based on these proxies and evaluate it in Santander smart city. The results demonstrate that it is able to discover and manage IoT sensors connected to both oneM2M and FIWARE. It appears that the semantic approach provides the flexibility and dynamic adaptivity needed for fast growing and rapidly changing urban environments. © 2014 IEEE."
An extension of the misci middleware for smart cities based on fog computing,"In a Smart City is required computational platforms, which allow environments with multiple interconnected and embedded systems, where the technology is integrated with the people, and can respond to unpredictable situations. One of the biggest challenges in developing Smart City is how to describe and dispose of enormous and multiple sources of information, and how to share and merge it into a single infrastructure. In previous works, we have proposed an Autonomic Reflective Middleware with emerging and ubiquitous capabilities, which is based on intelligent agents that can be adapted to the existing dynamism in a city for, ubiquitously, respond to the requirements of citizens, using emerging ontologies that allow the adaptation to the context. In this work, we extend this middleware using the fog computing paradigm, to solve this problem. The fog extends the cloud to be closer to the things that produce and act on the smart city. In this paper, we present the extension to the middleware, and examples of utilization in different situations in a smart city. © 2017 IGI Global.
