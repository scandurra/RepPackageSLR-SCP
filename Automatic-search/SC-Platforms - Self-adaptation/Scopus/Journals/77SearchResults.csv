As a main bearer of current Mobile Networks, LTE/LTE-A carries massive and important business data but is facing more and more serious attack situations, which makes the Security Measurement over it become necessary and important. However, current methods are usually designed from specific malicious detections, which cannot provide the user with a synthetic view of security evaluation. Meanwhile, as the massive amount and poor quality of networking data are considered, the efficiency and accuracy of the current security measurement methods are usually not good. In this paper, we focus on the evaluation basis (the collecting data) of security measurement over LTE/LTE-A networks, and propose an Adaptive Security Data Collection and Composition Recognition (ASDCCR) method for it. We design heuristic algorithms and processing framework in ASDCCR to make the data collection adaptive and synthetic attack recognition become possible. We also verified the proposed method in simulated LTE environment of NS3 to verify the usability and accuracy of the proposed methods. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Data collection algorithm; Data composition algorithm; Data processing; LTE network security; NS3 simulation; Security measurement"

In centralized computational systems, hyperparameter optimization and regularization techniques such as dropout are computational means to enhance learning performance by adjusting the deep hierarchical structure. However, in decentralized deep learning by the Internet of Things, the structure is an actual network of autonomous interconnected devices such as smart phones that interact via complex network protocols. Self-adaptation of the learning structure is a challenge. Uncertainties such as network latency, node and link failures or even bottlenecks by limited processing capacity and energy availability can significantly downgrade learning performance. Network self-organization and self-management is complex, while it requires additional computational and network resources that hinder the feasibility of decentralized deep learning. In contrast, this paper introduces a self-adaptive learning approach based on holarchic learning structures for exploring, mitigating and boosting learning performance in distributed environments with uncertainties. A large-scale performance analysis with 864,000 experiments fed with synthetic and real-world data from smart grid and smart city pilot projects confirm the cost-effectiveness of holarchic structures for decentralized deep learning. © 2019, The Author(s).","Deep learning; Holarchy; Multi-agent system; Optimization; Resilience; Smart city"

In general, these proposals tend to take too much care of the representation of data, but they tend to set aside the user experience (UX). New systems try to improve the experiences citizens in Smart Cities platforms, because many of these government platforms are not user-friendly and their quality, in terms of UX, are not up to the task. To solve this problem, both in the interface design and UX, the solution proposed in this article is the application of Adaptive Interface Ecosystems (AIE), a new concept that can be applied to existing interfaces. The advantage of using AIE on developed and in operation interfaces is that it is not necessary to redesign the interface, but rather they will be adjusted (adapting over time) to each user's own way of using and monitoring it. The AIEs give the possibility of perfecting the initial modeling of an interface, collecting and analyzing the segmented data of citizens’ interactions. The proposed model has been evaluated by expert users in a real scenario and compared with other existing software with similar features. © 2019","Adaptive interface ecosystems; Smart cities platforms; User experience"

"SEAL: SDN based secure and agile framework for protecting smart city applications from DDoS attacks",2019,"10.1016/j.jnca.2019.06.001","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069973339&doi=10.1016%2fj.jnca.2019.06.001&partnerID=40&md5=91ab76d387d0a90eb41f0b0da11bc7f6","Evolution of smart cities induces critical challenges related to cyber and network security. The increased reliance of a smart city on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure improves automation, efficiency, and sustainability of city services. However, it also poses enormous challenges for ensuring continued operations and services at all times and especially under cyber-attacks. Any lapse in cyber security can lead to critical disaster across the city. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are considered to be the most predominant and prevalent cyber-attacks. We believe that smart city could consist of numerous applications with varying level of network and security requirements. Therefore, providing an adaptive mechanism against DDoS attacks for all applications in a smart city is a key challenge. Further, considering the wide-scale requirements of a smart city, developing an adaptive and flexible solution is a key requirement. Considering these requirements, this paper presents SEAL (SEcure and AgiLe) – a novel Software Defined Networking (SDN) based adaptive framework for protecting smart city applications against DDoS attacks. The SEAL framework leverages key characteristics of SDN such as the global visibility, centralized control, and programmability to enhance the security and resilience. SEAL is capable of effectively detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks not only on application servers but also on network resources. SEAL is also unique in this regard that it provides application specific DDoS attack security solution instead of static threshold mechanism. Moreover, inherently distributed architecture of the SEAL framework ensures fault tolerance, scalability and reliability of the smart city. The SEAL framework comprises three modules, namely D-Defense, A-Defense and C-Defense. These modules collectively provide a mechanism to detect and mitigate DDoS attack on smart city applications and the network infrastructure. Adaptability in SEAL is achieved through implementing customized version of estimated-weighted moving average (EWMA) filters. Three types of filters, Proactive Filter, Active Filter, and Passive Filter are proposed and implemented to compute the dynamic threshold in real time for various types of applications. Experimental evaluation of the SEAL framework has been conducted to establish the efficacy of the framework and its components in detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks. The results prove that SEAL is able to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks effectively. The focus of the SEAL framework is to protect smart city applications, however, the SEAL framework can potentially be utilized in a wide range of systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","DDoS attacks; SDN security; Smart city; Smart city security; Software defined networking"

PID controllers are an integral and most commonly used tuning method for control over non-linear systems due to their simplicity and ease of computational complexity. PID controllers are most useful to systems in real time in which the system control parameters vary very slowly or exhibit uncertainty consequently making prediction very complicated and delayed. Continuous and quick adaptation of PID controllers towards varying input determines the efficiency of the non-linear system and this research paper presents a radial basis neural network model in a chaotic configuration for tuning the PID controller in an adaptive manner. However, because mobile cloud computing inherits some characteristics of mobile computing itself, there may be problems such as network congestion, no signal area and crosstalk, which leads to the frequent failure of computing resources and service cooperation, which makes the availability of mobile cloud computing more difficult than traditional cloud calculate the more severe challenges. The scope of this research work is limited to training the neural network with a chaotic map and time series plots are obtained using the experimental results. The efficiency of the proposed chaotic network model is justified by the evaluation of accuracy and robustness of the model even in presence of disturbances. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Adaptive PID tuning; Chaotic neural networks; Dynamic response; Stability"

A smart city aims to provide a single technological platform through integrating all its services, devices, interfaces, and infrastructure, allowing the city to operate in an intelligent way that can support social and benefit from the user experience. In this context, one of the critical issues associated with fast urbanization is traffic management, which needs intelligent infrastructures. In this paper, aiming to enhance public security, improve user experience, and ensure smooth traffic flow, a road traffic signal control mechanism is proposed to automatically control the duration of a green light signal at the signalized road intersections by using an intelligent fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS). This can assist traffic signal plan, which dynamically adjusts the time required for switching between green and red lights. For this purpose, the concept of traffic context based on user experience is proposed to define the context in terms of the number of vehicles, the number of pedestrians, time of day, and the weather conditions as the inputs for the fuzzy control system. The proposed system was designed keeping in view the busy junctions joining important and busy areas; the system is effective for traffic congestion control, energy saving, and enhancing public security and comfort. Also, the FRBS-assisted system is very flexible and not limited to the defined antecedents; consequently, it can be easily extended to accommodate other variables on demand, making it adaptive to any road intersection scenario. © BEIESP.","Fuzzy Rule-Based System; Intelligent transportation systems; Traffic context; User experience"

To improve the security of sensitive personal information (SPI) in cyber-physical systems, we present some novel ideas related to the encryption of SPI. Currently, there are issues in traditional encryption methods, such as low speed of information acquisition, low recognition rate, low utilization rate of effective information resources, and high delay of information query. To address these issues, we propose a novel efficient encryption algorithm for the security of incremental SPI. First, our proposed method analyzes user information resources and determines valid data to be encrypted. Next, it uses adaptive acquisition methods to collect information, and uses our encryption method to complete secure encryption of SPI according to the acquisition results. Our experimental analysis clearly shows that the algorithm effectively improves the speed of information acquisition as well as effective information recognition rate, thus enhancing the security of SPI. The encryption model in turn can provide a strong guarantee for user information security. © 2019 by the authors.

Although coarse patch-level deep learning crack detection models abound in the literature and have shown promise, the coarse level of detail provided, together with the requirement for fixed-size input images, significantly detract from their applicability and usefulness for refined damage analysis. The deep fully convolutional model for crack detection introduced in this paper (CrackPix) leverages well-known image classification architectures for dense predictions by transforming their fully connected layers into convolutional filters. A transposed convolution layer is then used to upsample and resize the resulting prediction heatmap to the size of the input images, thus providing pixel-level predictions. To develop and train these models, a concrete crack image data set was collected and carefully annotated at the pixel level and was then used to train the model. Sensitivity analysis showed that CrackPix was capable of correctly detecting over 92% of crack pixels and 99.9% of noncrack pixels in the validation set. The model performance was then compared against a state-of-the-art patchwise model, as well as traditional edge detection and adaptive thresholding alternatives, and its advantages were illustrated.

In this IoT network infrastructure Cognitive Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), as a network of nodes that work in a cooperative way to sense the spectrum and control the environment surrounding them, are one of the main technologies. Security and privacy appear as key aspects for the development of new applications and services. In this work we propose a novel artificial noise generation strategy based on game theory in order to improve the security against privacy attacks in CWSNs. Artificial noise generation consists in introducing interferences in the spectrum in order to mask the real information. The decision whether or not to introduce artificial noise is modeled through a light non-cooperative game designed for low-resources networks that balance security enhancement and energy consumption. We show, using several simulations, that even with a cognitive attacker our strategy has reduced the information obtained by the attacker (Secrecy Outage Probability) to a value under 10%. The overhead (energy consumption and spectrum occupancy) of the strategy has also been deeply analyzed. All possible cases our approach provides better results, in the ratio energy consumption - security, than not using the strategy or using a random noise generation strategy. Also, although the saturation of the radio spectrum is strongly affected, the reliability of the network is maintained in 95% of application packages received. Therefore, we can conclude that an improvement of the privacy in the physical layer is obtained, taking into account energy consumption and maintaining levels of spectrum saturation suitable for the application proposes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Artificial noise generation; Cognitive radio; Cooperative communications; Energy efficiency; Game theory; Physical layer security; Security; Wireless sensor networks"

Applications targeting such environments require adaptability and context-sensitivity to uncertain availability and failures in resources and their ad-hoc networks. Such heterogeneity is often hard to predict, making the deployment process a challenging task. Objective: This paper proposes GoalD as a goal-driven framework to support autonomous deployment of heterogeneous computational resources to fulfill requirements, seen as goals, and their correlated components on one hand, and the variability space of the hosting computing and sensing environment on the other hand. Method: GoalD comprises an offline and an online stage to fulfill autonomous deployment by leveraging the use of goals. Deployment configuration strategies arise from the variability structure of the Contextual Goal Model as an underlying structure to guide autonomous planning by selecting available as well as suitable resources at runtime. Results: We evaluate GoalD on an existing exemplar from the self-adaptive systems community – the Tele Assistance Service provided by Weyns and Calinescu [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability of GoalD on a repository consisting of 430,500 artifacts. The evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of GoalD in planning the deployment of a system with thousands of components in a few milliseconds. Conclusion: GoalD is a framework to systematically tackle autonomous deployment in highly heterogeneous computing environments, partially unknown at design-time following a goal-oriented approach to achieve the user goals in a target environment. GoalD has demonstrated itself able to scale for deployment planning dealing with thousands of components in a few milliseconds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Autonomous deployment; Contextual goal modelling; Deployment planning; Heterogeneous computational resources"

One of the major IoT application areas that gets significant attention is smart city. Since it is unrealistic to expect full convergence toward a single IoT platform in the near future, it is mandatory to enable interworking between different platforms based on multiple standards, coexisting in the emerging smart cities. In this paper, we take the example of two global IoT standards, FIWARE and oneM2M, which are actively used in many smart city projects, and analyze them to show the feasibility of IoT platforms interworking. Based on the analysis, we design and implement a novel IoT interworking architecture providing a semantic driven integration framework suitable for smart city. The core idea behind our approach is to introduce interworking proxies that: 1) conduct a static mapping of sensor information between IoT platforms and 2) perform semantic interoperability using semantically annotated resources via a semantic interworking proxy that dynamically discovers new kinds of information and adapts itself to enable automatic translation of semantic data between given source and target IoT platforms while it is running. We present the system based on these proxies and evaluate it in Santander smart city. The results demonstrate that it is able to discover and manage IoT sensors connected to both oneM2M and FIWARE. It appears that the semantic approach provides the flexibility and dynamic adaptivity needed for fast growing and rapidly changing urban environments. © 2014 IEEE.","FIWARE; Internet-of-Things (IoT); Interoperability; Interworking; Machine-to-machine (M2M); OneM2M; Semantics; Smart city; Standards"

Choosing a cluster head (CH) can appropriately balance the load in the network thereby reducing energy consumption and enhancing lifetime. This paper focuses on an efficient CH election scheme that rotates the CH position among the nodes with higher energy level as compared to other.

In other words, IoT is the driving force behind home automation, smart cities, modern health systems, and advanced manufacturing. This also increases the likelihood of cyber threats against IoT devices and services. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in application protocols, including Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) that interact directly with backend database systems and client-server applications to store data of IoT services. Successful exploitation of one or more of these protocols can result in data leakage and security breaches. In this paper, an ensemble intrusion detection technique is proposed to mitigate malicious events, in particular botnet attacks against DNS, HTTP, and MQTT protocols utilized in IoT networks. New statistical flow features are generated from the protocols based on an analysis of their potential properties. Then, an AdaBoost ensemble learning method is developed using three machine learning techniques, namely decision tree, Naive Bayes (NB), and artificial neural network, to evaluate the effect of these features and detect malicious events effectively. The UNSW-NB15 and NIMS botnet datasets with simulated IoT sensors' data are used to extract the proposed features and evaluate the ensemble technique. The experimental results show that the proposed features have the potential characteristics of normal and malicious activity using the correntropy and correlation coefficient measures. Moreover, the proposed ensemble technique provides a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate compared with each classification technique included in the framework and three other state-of-the-art techniques. © 2014 IEEE.","Botnet; Ensemble learning; Internet of Things (IoT); Network intrusion detection system (NIDS); Statistical flow features"

However, the highly dynamic traffic of a city means that no single traffic scenario is a precise representation of the real system, and the fitness of any candidate solution (traffic-light program) will vary when deployed on the city. Thus, ideal TLPs should not only have an optimized fitness, but also a high reliability, i.e., low fitness variance, against the uncertainties of the real-world. Earlier traffic-light optimization methods, e.g., based on genetic algorithms, often simulate a single traffic scenario, which neglects variance in the real-world, leading to TLPs not optimized for reliability. Our main contributions in this work are the following: (a) the analysis of the importance of reliable solutions for TLP optimization, even when all traffic scenarios are consistent with the real-world data and highly correlated; (b) the adaptation of IRACE, an iterated racing algorithm that is able to dynamically adjust the number of traffic scenarios required to evaluate the fitness of TLPs and their reliability; (c) the use of a large real-world case study for which real-time control is not possible and where data was obtained from sensors at the street level; and (d) a thorough analysis of solutions generated by means of IRACE, a Genetic Algorithm, a Differential Evolution, a Particle Swarm Optimization and a Random Search.

By introducing an auxiliary variable to denote the worst-case balancing cost, we transform the trilevel optimization problem into a single-level model considering generated representative scenarios. Moreover, we propose an iterative algorithm composed of nested problems, where the master problem solves the single-level robust model considering the binding scenario subset identified by the subproblem. In this way, a more computationally tractable model can be obtained, owing to the greatly reduced number of scenarios. Finally, test results on an integrated urban energy network verify the computational superiority of the proposed solution methodology afforded by identifying the binding scenario subset.

This has a lot to do with dynamic multiobjective optimization. In order to deal with this kind of problem, it is necessary to design a good processing strategy. Evolutionary algorithm can handle this problem well. The prediction in the dynamic environment has been the very challenging work. In the previous literature, the location and distribution of PF or PS are mostly predicted by the center point. The center point generally refers to the center point of the population in the decision space. However, the center point of the decision space cannot meet the needs of various problems. In fact, there are many points with special meanings in objective space, such as ideal point and CTI. In this paper, a hybrid prediction strategy carried through from both decision space and objective space (DOPS) is proposed to handle all kinds of optimization problems. The prediction in decision space is based on the center point. And the prediction in objective space is based on CTI. In addition, for handling the problems with periodic changes, a kind of memory method is added. Finally, to compensate for the inaccuracy of the prediction in particularly complex problems, a self-adaptive diversity maintenance method is adopted.

In this paper, we model the system state transformation as a Markov decision process, and an actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on a fuzzy normalized radial basis function neural network (called AC-FNRBF) is proposed to efficiently solve the intelligent transmission scheduling problem in CIoT systems under high-dimensional variables. The proposed AC-FNRBF algorithm can better approximate both the action function of the actor and the state&#x2013;action value function of the critic without requiring the system prior knowledge, and a new reward function is established to maximize the system benefit, which jointly takes the transmission packet rate, the system throughput, the power consumption, and the transmission delay into account. Moreover, the AC-FNRBF has the ability to adjust its learning structure and parameters in dynamic environments. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm achieves higher transmission packet rate and system throughput with lower power consumption and transmission delay, compared with other existing reinforcement learning algorithms.

With the development and advancement of computer technology, the emergence of intelligent transportation provides a better way to solve the problem of effectively alleviating traffic pressure and reducing the incidence of traffic accidents. In recent years, intelligent traffic monitoring system, as one of the important branches in the field of intelligent transportation, has also received more and more attention. Among them, video-based moving target recognition technology involves theoretical knowledge in various fields such as artificial intelligence, image processing, pattern recognition and computer vision. It is an important means to realize ""safe city"" and ""smart city"" and a key technology for intelligent monitoring. Therefore, the research on human motion target recognition algorithm in complex traffic environment has important theoretical and practical value. In the field of intelligent traffic monitoring, the moving target detection and recognition effect of video images will have certain influence on the classification and behavior understanding of subsequent moving targets. In this paper, the commonly used moving target detection methods are studied first, and the convergence problem of the traditional Adaboost algorithm is improved. An Adaboost algorithm based on adaptive weight update is proposed, and then the support vector machine (SVM) is used. The algorithm identifies the detected moving target. Finally, through simulation experiments on the acquired video images, the results show that the proposed human motion target recognition algorithm based on adaptive weight update Adaboost and SVM has good feasibility and rationality. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Adaboost algorithm; Intelligent transportation; moving target recognition; support vector machine"

When this happens, the selected video portions must be uploaded within a given deadline, using (multiple) wireless interfaces, with different costs (which correspond to, e.g., tariffs). We study this video upload problem as a scheduling problem with deadline, where our goal is to choose which interfaces to use and when, so as to minimize the cost of the upload while meeting the given deadline. Our study gives rise to adaptive schedulers that require only a very coarse knowledge of the wireless interfaces bandwidth. In this paper, we first assume an oracle has the perfect knowledge about the available bandwidth of wireless interfaces at each time, and we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the upload cost within the given deadline. Second, we propose greedy oracle-based heuristics that perform very close to optimal, and that can provide a simple baseline for performance. Third, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem, assuming only the knowledge of the distribution of available bandwidth, and, fourth, we propose adaptive schedulers, that we simulate and also implement and test in a real testbed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive solutions can effectively leverage the fundamental trade-off between upload cost and completion time, despite unpredictable variations in the available bandwidth of wireless interfaces.

Wi-Fi-based indoor localization using received signal strength (RSS) has drawn much attention over the past decade because it does not require extra infrastructure and specialized hardware. It is well known that the localization accuracy using RSS is rather susceptible to the changing environment. Localization by fusing multiple fingerprint functions of RSS is a promising strategy to overcome the above drawback. However, the existing fusion techniques cannot make full use of the intrinsic complementarity among multiple fingerprint functions. It also fails to exploit the knowledge obtained in the offline phase and thus shows low accuracy in the complex environment. This paper proposes a knowledge aided adaptive localization (KAAL) approach by using a global fusion profile (GFP) to mitigate the above shortcomings. First, we propose a GFP construction algorithm by minimizing position errors over all fingerprint functions with weight constraints in the offline phase. Based on the knowledge from GFP and the trained multiple fingerprint models, we then derive two KAAL algorithms, namely, multiple function averaging and optimal function selection, to achieve highly accurate localization results. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed localization approach is superior to the existing methods both in simulated and real environments. © 2017 IEEE.","Global fusion profile (GFP); indoor localization; knowledge aided adaptive localization (KAAL); received signal strength (RSS); Wi-Fi"

Specifically, we address the optimized upload planning problem, i.e. determine the optimal schedule for communication to enable timely data delivery under dynamicity in network connectivity, data characteristics/heterogeneity, and mobility. We develop a two-phase approach and associated policies, where an initial upload plan is generated offline with prior knowledge of networks and data, and a subsequent runtime adaptation alters the plan under multiple dynamics. To validate our approach, we designed and built SCALECycle, our mobile data collection platform, and deployed it in real communities in Rockville, MD and Irvine, CA. Measurements from these testbeds are used to drive extensive simulations. Experimental results indicate that compared with opportunistic operation, our two-phase approach using a judicious combination of policies can result in 30%–60% improvement in overall data utility, 30% reduction in collection delays, along with greater resilience to dynamicity and improved scalability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Community; Data collection; Internet of Things; Mobility; Upload planning"

In smart cities, numerous IoT-based services are likely to be available and a key challenge is to allow mobile users perform their daily tasks dynamically, by integrating the services available in their vicinity. Semantic Service Oriented Architectures (SSOA) abstract the environment's services and their functionalities as Semantic Web Services (SWS). However, existing service composition approaches based on SSOA do not support dynamic reasoning on user tasks and service behaviours to deal with the heterogeneity of IoT domains. In this paper, we present an adaptive service composition framework that supports such dynamic reasoning. The framework is based on wEASEL, an abstract service model representing services and user tasks in terms of their signature, specification (i.e., context-aware pre-conditions, post-conditions and effects) and conversation (i.e., behaviour with related data-flow and context-flow constraints). To evaluate our composition framework, we develop a novel OWLS-TC4-based testbed by combining simple and composite services. The evaluation shows that our wEASEL-based system performs more accurate composition and allows end-users to discover and investigate more composition opportunities than other approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Internet of Things; Real-time and semantic web services; Service modeling; Smart cities; Smart environments; Smart services; System design"

This paper describes a framework for real-Time semantic annotation and aggregation of data streams to support dynamic integration into the Web using the advanced message queuing protocol. We provide a comprehensive analysis on the effect of adaptive and nonadaptive window size in segmentation of time series using SensorSAX and symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) approaches for data streams with different variation and sampling rate in real-Time processing.

For the above reason, intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and location-based services (LBSs) have become an interesting research area over the last years. Due to the rapid increase of data volume within the transportation domain, cloud environment is of paramount importance for storing, accessing, handling, and processing such huge amounts of data. A large part of data within the transportation domain is produced in the form of Global Positioning System (GPS) data. Such a kind of data is usually infrequent and noisy and achieving the quality of real-time transport applications based on GPS is a difficult task. The map-matching process, which is responsible for the accurate alignment of observed GPS positions onto a road network, plays a pivotal role in many ITS applications. Regarding accuracy, the performance of a map-matching strategy is based on the shortest path between two consecutive observed GPS positions. On the other extreme, processing shortest path queries (SPQs) incurs high computational cost. Current map-matching techniques are approached with a fixed number of parameters, i.e., the number of candidate points (NCP) and error circle radius (ECR), which may lead to uncertainty when identifying road segments and either low-accurate results or a large number of SPQs. Moreover, due to the sampling error, GPS data with a high-sampling period (i.e., less than 10 s) typically contains extraneous datum, which also incurs an extra number of SPQs. Due to the high computation cost incurred by SPQs, current map-matching strategies are not suitable for real-time processing. In this paper, we propose real-time map-matching (called RT-MM), which is a fully adaptive map-matching strategy based on cloud to address the key challenge of SPQs in a map-matching process for real-time GPS trajectories. The evaluation of our approach against state-of-the-art approaches is performed through simulations based on both synthetic and real-world datasets. © 2016, Journal of Zhejiang University Science Editorial Office and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Bulk synchronous parallel; Cloud computing; GPS trajectories; Map-matching; Tuning-based"

In the IoT, millions of objects with sensors collect data and send the data to servers that analyze, manage and use the data in order to construct some kinds of smart systems, such as smart grid, intelligent transportation systems, healthcare systems and even smart city. It is critical to establish a secure channel between the sensors and servers in order to ensure the correctness of collected data. If the collected data is tampered, the results of data analysis is unbelievable, and may even bring serious disaster. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous ring signcryption scheme for secure communication from sensors to servers. We prove that this scheme has the indistinguishability against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA2) and existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen messages attacks under the computational Diffie–Hellman problem in the random oracle model. Our scheme has the following advantages (1) it simultaneously achieves confidentiality, integrity, authentication, non-repudiation and anonymity in a logical single step; (2) it is heterogeneous and allows a sensor node in an identity-based cryptography to send a message to a server in a public key infrastructure.

BEMSs control heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) and lighting systems in buildings; more specifically, they control HVAC's primary components such as air handling units (AHUs), chillers, and heating elements. BEMSs are essential components of modern buildings, tasked with seemingly contradicting requirements-minimizing energy consumption while maintaining occupants' comfort [1]. In the United States, about 40% of total energy consumption and 70% of electricity consumption are spent on buildings every year. These numbers are comparable to global statistics that about 30% of total energy consumption and 60% of electricity consumption are spent on buildings. Buildings are an integral part of global cyberphysical systems (smart cities) and evolve and interact with their surroundings (Figure 1) [2]. As buildings undergo years of exploitation, their thermal characteristics deteriorate, indoor spaces (especially in commercial buildings) get rearranged, and usage patterns change. In time, their inner (and outer) microclimates adjust to changes in surrounding buildings, overshadowing patterns, and city climates, not to mention building retrofitting [3], [4]. Thus, even in cases of ""ideally"" designed BEMS/HVAC systems, because of ever-changing and uncertain indoor and outdoor environments, their performance frequently falls short of expectations. Unfortunately, the complexity of BEMSs, large amounts of constantly changing data, and evolving interrelations among sensor feeds make identifying these suboptimal behaviors difficult [1], [5]. Therefore, traditional data-mining algorithms and data-analysis tools are often inadequate. © 2015 IEEE.",

Operating system virtualization based on containers as a mechanism to deploy and manage complex, large-scale software systems has become a popular mechanism for application deployment and operation. Packaging application components into selfcontained artifacts has brought substantial flexibility to developers and operation teams alike. However, this flexibility comes at a price. Practitioners need to respect numerous constraints ranging from security and compliance requirements, to specific regulatory conditions. Fulfilling these requirements is especially challenging in specialized domains with large numbers of stakeholders. Moreover, the rapidly growing number of container images to be managed due to the introduction of new or updated applications and respective components, leads to significant challenges for container management and adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Smart Brix, a framework for continuous evolution of container application deployments that tackles these challenges. Smart Brix integrates and unifies concepts of continuous integration, runtime monitoring, and operational analytics. Furthermore, it allows practitioners to define generic analytics and compensation pipelines composed of self-assembling processing components to autonomously validate and verify containers to be deployed. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach by evaluating our framework using a case study from the smart city domain.

Interconnected means the integration of those data into an enterprise computing platform and the communication of such information among the various city services. Intelligent refers to the inclusion of complex analytics, modeling, optimization, and visualization in the operational business processes to make better operational decisions. This approach enables the adaptation of city services to the behavior of the inhabitants, which permits the optimal use of the available physical infrastructure and resources, for example, in sensing and controlling consumption of energy and water, managing waste processing and transportation systems, and applying optimization to achieve new efficiencies among these resources. Additional roles exist in intelligent interaction between the city and its inhabitants and further contribute to operational efficiency while maintaining or enhancing quality of life. © 2010 IBM.",
