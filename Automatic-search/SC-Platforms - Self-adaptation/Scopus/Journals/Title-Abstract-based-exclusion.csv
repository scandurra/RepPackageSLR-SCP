In general, these proposals tend to take too much care of the representation of data, but they tend to set aside the user experience (UX). New systems try to improve the experiences citizens in Smart Cities platforms, because many of these government platforms are not user-friendly and their quality, in terms of UX, are not up to the task. To solve this problem, both in the interface design and UX, the solution proposed in this article is the application of Adaptive Interface Ecosystems (AIE), a new concept that can be applied to existing interfaces. The advantage of using AIE on developed and in operation interfaces is that it is not necessary to redesign the interface, but rather they will be adjusted (adapting over time) to each user's own way of using and monitoring it. The AIEs give the possibility of perfecting the initial modeling of an interface, collecting and analyzing the segmented data of citizens’ interactions. The proposed model has been evaluated by expert users in a real scenario and compared with other existing software with similar features. © 2019","Adaptive interface ecosystems; Smart cities platforms; User experience"
"SEAL: SDN based secure and agile framework for protecting smart city applications from DDoS attacks",2019,"10.1016/j.jnca.2019.06.001","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069973339&doi=10.1016%2fj.jnca.2019.06.001&partnerID=40&md5=91ab76d387d0a90eb41f0b0da11bc7f6","Evolution of smart cities induces critical challenges related to cyber and network security. The increased reliance of a smart city on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure improves automation, efficiency, and sustainability of city services. However, it also poses enormous challenges for ensuring continued operations and services at all times and especially under cyber-attacks. Any lapse in cyber security can lead to critical disaster across the city. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are considered to be the most predominant and prevalent cyber-attacks. We believe that smart city could consist of numerous applications with varying level of network and security requirements. Therefore, providing an adaptive mechanism against DDoS attacks for all applications in a smart city is a key challenge. Further, considering the wide-scale requirements of a smart city, developing an adaptive and flexible solution is a key requirement. Considering these requirements, this paper presents SEAL (SEcure and AgiLe) – a novel Software Defined Networking (SDN) based adaptive framework for protecting smart city applications against DDoS attacks. The SEAL framework leverages key characteristics of SDN such as the global visibility, centralized control, and programmability to enhance the security and resilience. SEAL is capable of effectively detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks not only on application servers but also on network resources. SEAL is also unique in this regard that it provides application specific DDoS attack security solution instead of static threshold mechanism. Moreover, inherently distributed architecture of the SEAL framework ensures fault tolerance, scalability and reliability of the smart city. The SEAL framework comprises three modules, namely D-Defense, A-Defense and C-Defense. These modules collectively provide a mechanism to detect and mitigate DDoS attack on smart city applications and the network infrastructure. Adaptability in SEAL is achieved through implementing customized version of estimated-weighted moving average (EWMA) filters. Three types of filters, Proactive Filter, Active Filter, and Passive Filter are proposed and implemented to compute the dynamic threshold in real time for various types of applications. Experimental evaluation of the SEAL framework has been conducted to establish the efficacy of the framework and its components in detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks. The results prove that SEAL is able to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks effectively. The focus of the SEAL framework is to protect smart city applications, however, the SEAL framework can potentially be utilized in a wide range of systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","DDoS attacks; SDN security; Smart city; Smart city security; Software defined networking"

In order to change the above status, catalogue management service system for smart city is introduced. In addition, the structural level of government information resources is analyzed. Cloud platform, information recommendation, string similarity matching and other technologies are used to connect and share the system information of the departmental government. In this case, the catalogue information resources are used wisely. The LPvA-Index index structure is given based on the existing Gram–Trie tree. LPvA-Index adaptively selects the appropriate length of the Prefix filter, resulting in fewer inverted tables. In addition, filters are used during reads, thus reducing the number of candidate sets and increasing the query efficiency of strings. At the same time, the length segmentation and location segmentation methods are applied to the Gram–Trie tree. Finally, the test platform is built.

"GoalD: A Goal-Driven deployment framework for dynamic and heterogeneous computing environments",2019,"10.1016/j.infsof.2019.04.003","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064225214&doi=10.1016%2fj.infsof.2019.04.003&partnerID=40&md5=b457fb2b5cdc28e66b87400011ed02ec","Context: Emerging paradigms like Internet of Things and Smart Cities utilize advanced sensing and communication infrastructures, where heterogeneity is an inherited feature. Applications targeting such environments require adaptability and context-sensitivity to uncertain availability and failures in resources and their ad-hoc networks. Such heterogeneity is often hard to predict, making the deployment process a challenging task. Objective: This paper proposes GoalD as a goal-driven framework to support autonomous deployment of heterogeneous computational resources to fulfill requirements, seen as goals, and their correlated components on one hand, and the variability space of the hosting computing and sensing environment on the other hand. Method: GoalD comprises an offline and an online stage to fulfill autonomous deployment by leveraging the use of goals. Deployment configuration strategies arise from the variability structure of the Contextual Goal Model as an underlying structure to guide autonomous planning by selecting available as well as suitable resources at runtime. Results: We evaluate GoalD on an existing exemplar from the self-adaptive systems community – the Tele Assistance Service provided by Weyns and Calinescu [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability of GoalD on a repository consisting of 430,500 artifacts. The evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of GoalD in planning the deployment of a system with thousands of components in a few milliseconds. Conclusion: GoalD is a framework to systematically tackle autonomous deployment in highly heterogeneous computing environments, partially unknown at design-time following a goal-oriented approach to achieve the user goals in a target environment. GoalD has demonstrated itself able to scale for deployment planning dealing with thousands of components in a few milliseconds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Autonomous deployment; Contextual goal modelling; Deployment planning; Heterogeneous computational resources"

One of the major IoT application areas that gets significant attention is smart city. Since it is unrealistic to expect full convergence toward a single IoT platform in the near future, it is mandatory to enable interworking between different platforms based on multiple standards, coexisting in the emerging smart cities. In this paper, we take the example of two global IoT standards, FIWARE and oneM2M, which are actively used in many smart city projects, and analyze them to show the feasibility of IoT platforms interworking. Based on the analysis, we design and implement a novel IoT interworking architecture providing a semantic driven integration framework suitable for smart city. The core idea behind our approach is to introduce interworking proxies that: 1) conduct a static mapping of sensor information between IoT platforms and 2) perform semantic interoperability using semantically annotated resources via a semantic interworking proxy that dynamically discovers new kinds of information and adapts itself to enable automatic translation of semantic data between given source and target IoT platforms while it is running. We present the system based on these proxies and evaluate it in Santander smart city. The results demonstrate that it is able to discover and manage IoT sensors connected to both oneM2M and FIWARE. It appears that the semantic approach provides the flexibility and dynamic adaptivity needed for fast growing and rapidly changing urban environments. © 2014 IEEE.","FIWARE; Internet-of-Things (IoT); Interoperability; Interworking; Machine-to-machine (M2M); OneM2M; Semantics; Smart city; Standards"

The purpose of this work is to demonstrate such a combination, on one hand at the service level, through integrating smart cities platforms for user level data, and on the other hand at Complex Event Processing, Storage and Analytics capabilities together with Twitter data. The final goal is to identify events of interest to the user such as Large Crowd Concentration (LCC) in a given area, in order to enrich application level information with related event identification that can enable more sophisticated actions on behalf of that user. The identification is based on observation of Twitter activity peaks compared to historical data on a dynamic time and location of interest.

In smart cities, numerous IoT-based services are likely to be available and a key challenge is to allow mobile users perform their daily tasks dynamically, by integrating the services available in their vicinity. Semantic Service Oriented Architectures (SSOA) abstract the environment's services and their functionalities as Semantic Web Services (SWS). However, existing service composition approaches based on SSOA do not support dynamic reasoning on user tasks and service behaviours to deal with the heterogeneity of IoT domains. In this paper, we present an adaptive service composition framework that supports such dynamic reasoning. The framework is based on wEASEL, an abstract service model representing services and user tasks in terms of their signature, specification (i.e., context-aware pre-conditions, post-conditions and effects) and conversation (i.e., behaviour with related data-flow and context-flow constraints). To evaluate our composition framework, we develop a novel OWLS-TC4-based testbed by combining simple and composite services. The evaluation shows that our wEASEL-based system performs more accurate composition and allows end-users to discover and investigate more composition opportunities than other approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Internet of Things; Real-time and semantic web services; Service modeling; Smart cities; Smart environments; Smart services; System design"

Smarter Cities are urban areas that exploit operational data, such as that arising from traffic congestion, power consumption statistics, and public safety events, to optimize the operation of city services. The foundational concepts are instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent. Instrumented refers to sources of near-real-time real-world data from both physical and virtual sensors. Interconnected means the integration of those data into an enterprise computing platform and the communication of such information among the various city services. Intelligent refers to the inclusion of complex analytics, modeling, optimization, and visualization in the operational business processes to make better operational decisions. This approach enables the adaptation of city services to the behavior of the inhabitants, which permits the optimal use of the available physical infrastructure and resources, for example, in sensing and controlling consumption of energy and water, managing waste processing and transportation systems, and applying optimization to achieve new efficiencies among these resources. Additional roles exist in intelligent interaction between the city and its inhabitants and further contribute to operational efficiency while maintaining or enhancing quality of life. © 2010 IBM.",
