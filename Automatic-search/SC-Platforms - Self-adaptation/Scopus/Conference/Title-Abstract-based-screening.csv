"Vision for a holistic smart city-HSC: Integrating resiliency framework via Crowdsourced Community Resiliency Information System (CRIS)",2019,"10.1145/3356395.3365541","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077317486&doi=10.1145%2f3356395.3365541&partnerID=40&md5=060c319c1affd4d70e068b47d61b2f00","This vision paper discusses future directions and existing gaps in integrating smart city initiatives with resilience frameworks. It proposes the use of a multi-modular crowdsourced Community Resiliency Information System (CRIS) to overcome traditional smart citiesâĂŹ focus on infrastructure and grid vulnerabilities/resiliency while overlooking socio-economic vulnerabilities. CRIS is conceptualized based on our previous research which identified the importance of customized information and targeted resources to foster preparedness, adaptation and resiliency among diverse communities. Our proposed vision of a smart city integrated with CRIS allows scalable and customizable solutions for policy-makers using information generated âĂŸby the peopleâĂŹ, thus ensuring participation of diverse communities in smart city technology, thus creating a Holistic Smart City (HSC). CRIS will foster a two-way communication between government and communities by creating a grassroots, community-based, technology-enhanced needs assessment and disaster-response information system. Among other benefits, CRIS will generate and organize data to be used by the local community and policy makers and foster ongoing dialogue between neighborhoods and policymakers. CRIS will foster social capital at the neighborhood level by increasing grassroots knowledge and access to resources and information, fostering preparedness, adaptation, and resiliency/recovery, and aiding decision-makers in resource allocation and customized communications. CRIS moves the smart city beyond a mere infrastructure to create an interactive space for information exchange, democratic participation and a collaborative resilience-building process. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Community engagement; Crowdsourced; GIS; Integrated Decision Support System"
"The CitySpin platform: A CPSS environment for city-wide infrastructures",2019,,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078204077&partnerID=40&md5=406c4d7a0a62c9962024141f08df70ae","Cyber-physical Social System (CPSS) are complex systems that span the boundaries of the cyber, physical and social spheres. They play an important role in a variety of domains ranging from industry to smart city applications. As such, these systems necessarily need to take into account, combine and make sense of heterogeneous data sources from legacy systems, from the physical layer and also the social groups that are part of/use the system. The collection, cleansing and integration of these data sources represents a major effort not only during the operation of the system, but also during its engineering and design. Indeed, while ongoing efforts are concerned primarily with the operation of such systems, limited focus has been put on supporting the engineering phase of CPSS. To address this shortcoming, within the CitySPIN project we aim to create a platform that supports stakeholders involved in the design of these systems especially in terms of support for data management. To that end, we develop methods and techniques based on Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies for the acquisition and integration of heterogeneous data from disparate structured, semi-structured and unstructured sources, including open data and social data. In this paper we present the overall system architecturewith a core focus on data acquisition and integration.We demon-strate our approach through a prototypical implementation of an adaptive planning use case for public transportation scheduling.

We propose a dynamic federation of computational resources of smart objects as a virtual distributed system according to users’ requirements and context. The approach presented in this paper has two key ideas. The first is to federate multiple smart objects or application-specific services as a virtual computer and the second is to separate between services for users from context-aware policies of such services. The approach was constructed as a general-purpose middleware system for executing and deploying application-specific software at smart objects. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Ambeint Intelligence; Middleware; Mobile agent"

As people started to move from rural areas into cities, cities started to have congestion, traffic, crimes, increased carbon emissions, illiteracy, and unemployment. Cities have to manage these complexities by finding smart solutions. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has launched the strategy to transform Dubai into a smart city and to be ready for expo 2020 that could result in road traffic and increased tourism. Other reasons for Dubai to become a smart city are that are the business and real estate boom, because foreign investments are pouring in and many populations are coming to Dubai, so it needs to have sustainability. Dubai is in a state where it requires having sustainable energies and buildings to accept many populations. A framework is a set of principles and guidelines to prepare the right components and people, and taking the right steps and stages to achieve the outcomes. A roadmap is a vision done by stakeholders, of the final outcome of the desired project, and it takes from 10 to 50 years. A roadmap is a plan or strategy intended to achieve a particular goal. This research has studied various smart city initiatives in the world and the numerous frameworks on smart cities. An adaptive framework specifically for Dubai City has been proposed and a roadmap for its implementation has been suggested. This outcome can be used by the Government of Dubai to plan their smart city strategies. © 2017 IEEE.","Smart City; Smart Government"

However, the latest evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data analysis gave new insights of smart platforms that can potentially lead to the new dream of 'smart cities'. The paper presented a survey such latest technologies that can lead to a new paradigm of a smart home, based on classifying the basic components of such systems and present the previous work in each component. Moreover, SLASH framework is proposed for designing and implementing smart home systems that are both adaptive and self-learning. Our framework suggests integrating IoT across every home with a large network connected to Big Data analyser. Such an engine that supports analysing inhabitants' behaviours on a large-scale can enable a new type of home automation that depends on machine learning and develops on-going automation decision over time. Essentially, this approach holds some challenges that are considered throughout the framework or state for future enhancements. © 2017 IEEE.","Big Data; Context-awareness; Embedded Systems; Human-Building Interaction; Internet of Things; Smart Homes; Ubiquitous Computing"

However, being in the world of Big Data we had to find a way that helps us in maintaining the benefits of this data while reducing its size. That’s why in this paper we focus on transforming Big Data into smart data. To achieve this goal, the work of this research is dedicated to finding the optimal way of storing data in the collaborated surveillance system, CityPro. In its proposed architecture it implied using an adaptation of a federated star-schema like data repository for storage. The repository is opted to store summarized data instead of the huge amounts of data coming from partners, which will help in moving from the nomenclature of Big Data to smart data. To attain this property, we are trying to propose a new technology by creating a global unified profile for each individual in the city, which will facilitate the monitoring of suspects and predict their moves. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

We focused the attention on monitoring the environment quality in urban area by means of a distributed network of small mobile sensors that are devices on the Internet of Things (IoT). Sensors produce digital measurements, useful for investigating and studying the life quality in every part of the city. In our vision, environmental data must be available by everyone and shared with citizens, but it must be unmodifiable. We propose to solve the problem of the sensors data storage and management using a disruptive technology called blockchain. The blockchain responds to the demand of availability and unchangeability and, thanks to the potentiality of smart contracts, makes us able to manage sensor information and implement a control logic. In order to develop the software based on blockchain we chose to apply the SCRUM methodology because of its capabilities of being a flexible, adaptive and iterative methodology. © 2017 ACM.","Blockchain; Internet of things; SCRUM; Sensing; Smart cities"

These IoT frameworks are used to collect, process and analyse data streams in real-time and facilitate provision of smart solutions designed to provide decision support. Existing IoT-based solutions are mainly domain-dependent, providing stream processing and analytics focusing on specific areas (smart cities, healthcare etc.). In the context of agri-food industry, a variety of external parameters belonging to different domains (e.g. weather conditions, regulations etc.) have a major influence over the food supply chain, while flexible and adaptive IoT frameworks, essential to truly realize the concept of smart farming, are currently inexistent. In this paper, we propose Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT-based smart farming applications, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time. Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications. Agri-IoT supports large-scale data analytics and event detection, ensuring seamless interoperability among sensors, services, processes, operations, farmers and other relevant actors, including online information sources and linked open datasets and streams available on the Web. © 2016 IEEE.","Agriculture; Framework; Internet of Things; Semantic Web; Smart Farming"

It is common to recognize six axes of work in them: i) Smart Economy, ii) Smart People, iii) Smart Governance, iv) Smart Mobility, v) Smart Environment, and vi) Smart Living. In this tutorial we first focus on a capital issue: smart mobility. European citizens and economic actors need a transport system which provides them with seamless, high-quality door-to-door mobility. At the same time, the adverse effects of transport on the climate, the environment and human health need to be reduced. We will show many new systems based in the use of bio-inspired techniques to ease the road traffic flow in the city, as well as allowing a customized smooth experience for travellers (private and public transport). This tutorial will then discuss on potential applications of intelligent systems for energy (like adaptive lighting in streets), environmental applications (like mobile sensors for air pollution), smart building (intelligent design), and several other applications linked to smart living, tourism, and smart municipal governance. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Holistic approach; Intelligent systems; Smart cities"

Protecting critical infrastructures and ensuring their continued operation will be an important part of future Smart City ecosystems. Minimising the destruction of failing critical infrastructure components or system components that are geographically close critical services is essential. Equally important are the system of systems relationships that a failing system has, as these could render a minor system critical under certain circumstances. Infrastructure failure is usually brought under control through system adaptation e.g. using sensor area networks to close valves or by emergency response e.g. extinguishing fires. Current response procedures rely on antiquated information sharing techniques and provide little or no opportunity to effect change within the failing infrastructures systems. There may also be minimal understanding of the important systems of systems role that is being provided by components of the failing system. This paper details our initial work on the Smart Cities Critical Infrastructure response framework. The goal of our framework is to provide a response strategy to first responders based on smart cities information flows. Where these information flows have been compromised we propose a robust infrastructure state preservation system as to provide an interface to a failing critical infrastructure. © 2011 IEEE.","Critical infrastructure; Emergency response; Internet of things; Smart cities"

Leveraging information technology to allow better demand and supply management of key urban infrastructure system offer immense opportunities for efficiency and quality of service improvements in urban services. In this paper, we argue that implementing sensor networks are a necessary but not sufficient approach to improving urban living. Building on the concept of the cognitive city discussed elsewhere by the authors, this paper proposed an architectural process approach that allows city decision-makers and service providers to integrate cognition into urban processes. Cognition is the ability of a system to learn from previous experiences and adapt its behavior based on them. A cognitive system is able to sense, perceive and respond to changes in the environment and can therefore improve a system's performance by increasing its adaptive capacity. © 2011 IEEE.","Cognitive City; crowdsourcing; intelligent infrastructure; Smart City; urban systems; Wireless sensors"
