In this way different types of interaction are provided, such as direct manipulation, web UI or tangible interaction. These interfaces have evolved, including artificial intelligence and adaptation mechanisms to answer the evolution of the technological areas. From this evolution emerged the intelligent user interfaces that aim to be more effective, efficient, and natural. Considering the importance of IUI nowadays, we have performed a systematic literature review to investigate the design trends of IUIs in the context of contemporary software systems, such as software systems based on internet of things (IoT) or dedicated to smart cities. Preliminary results show which models and technologies are most used to develop IUIs, and which application domain is mostly represented. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).","Evidence-based software engineering; Intelligent user interface; Systemic literature review"

We consider the areas where widespread free WiFi is not prevalent; instead, the platform needs to rely on expensive and metered cellular data connections with limited data budgets. For the better utilization of the limited data plan, we apply two adaptation techniques in sensemaking. First, we adjust sensing intervals of periodic sensors so that the data volume remains bounded within the plan. Second, we enable putting application-specific software modules on-board through containers to process media data locally and thus to reduce bulk upload. The platform we developed is called EnviroSCALE (Environmental Sensing and Community Alert Network), which hosts a set of air quality sensors on a Raspberry Pi and uses a 3G connection to upload data. We outline our deployment experience of EnviroSCALE in Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",

CRIS will foster a two-way communication between government and communities by creating a grassroots, community-based, technology-enhanced needs assessment and disaster-response information system. Among other benefits, CRIS will generate and organize data to be used by the local community and policy makers and foster ongoing dialogue between neighborhoods and policymakers. CRIS will foster social capital at the neighborhood level by increasing grassroots knowledge and access to resources and information, fostering preparedness, adaptation, and resiliency/recovery, and aiding decision-makers in resource allocation and customized communications.

To achieve the optimum signal timing, many studies attempt to adjust green splits of a cycle time according to the distance between the road intersections. However, the existing green wave traffic control system usually has a sophisticated calculation, which depends upon the stability of vehicle speed and traffic flow, leading to weak robustness. Therefore, this short paper puts forward ES-Band, that is, a novel approach to control arterial traffic coordination with the help of artificial intelligence. ES-Band introduces the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategies (CMA-ES), a scalable alternative to reinforcement learning, into signal timing. Different traffic variables are adopted as parameters for searching the optimal value by CMA-ES. In order to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of ES-Band, we import the real traffic flow data of Zhongshan Road in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China, into traffic environment simulator for training and carry out a series of experiments.

In this paradigm shift, systems demand conceptual frameworks, techniques, and mathematically-backed formalisms to treat change and achieve decentralization. We outline a vision for addressing fundamental challenges that software engineering and distributed systems research encounters when building resilient IoT systems.

Existing barriers like increased congestion, multiple signalized intersections, queued vehicles, traffic phase timing etc. can prevent emergency vehicles (EVs) achieving desired response times. Existing solutions to route EVs have not been successful because they do not use dynamic traffic parameters. Real time information on increased congestion, halts on road, pedestrian flow, queued vehicles, real and adaptive speed, can be used to properly actuate pre-emption and minimise the impact that EV movement can have on other traffic.Smart cities provide the necessary infrastructure to enable two critical factors in EV routing: real-time traffic data and connectivity.

The large volume of complex traffic and the uncertainty of market supplies/demands have made it essential for many MOD service providers to proactively dispatch vehicles towards ride-seekers. To meet this need effectively, we propose STRide, an MOD coordination-learning mechanism reinforced spatio-temporally with capsules. We formalize the adaptive coordination of vehicles into a reinforcement learning framework. STRide incorporates spatial and temporal distributions of supplies (vehicles) and demands (ride requests), customers' preferences and other external factors. A novel spatio-temporal capsule neural network is designed to predict the provider's rewards based on MOD network states, vehicles and their dispatch actions.

The smart surveillance applications are equipped with camera sensors to automatically detect and identify potential regions through automated object detection methods. Usually, such methods require high-complexity image processing techniques and algorithms.

A novel unified technique is proposed to detect a moving object from the surveillance videos based on CPU (central processing units). Unlike most of the existing methods that are relying on pixel information, we use a block-based texture and spatial-Temporal information. We use this method to determine the area of the detected moving object(s) only. Furthermore, the area will be processed through a deep learning-based image classification in GPU (graphics processing units) in order to ensure high efficiency and accuracy.

However, how to detect moving targets in the dynamic high-altitude environment with restricted computational resources is one of the most critical ones. Furthermore, during the detection, the moving target could travel in dynamic speed and be blocked by dense-obstructer, such as woods and buildings. In this paper, we develop an online drone-based moving target detection (ODMTD)system, which performs moving target detection in dense-obstructer areas.

In accounting for personalized thermal comfort inference, the predicted mean vote (PMV) model is not often applicable and data-driven methods using features from ambient environmental conditions have demonstrated moderate accuracies (60-75%). Therefore, the use of physiological sensing for improved performance has gained attention in recent years. Skin temperature has been widely used as an alternative indicator of human heat dissipation adjustment, which could be leveraged for personalized thermal comfort inference. However, considering the heat dissipation adjustments through skin as an adaptation mechanism in an environment, in this study, we have investigated the hypothesis that heat flux sensors could be an effective alternative for enabling feedback from human body to the control system. To this end, we designed and conducted an experimental study on 10 human subjects, wearing a thin-film heat flux sensor on their wrist, under transient thermal conditions (from 20 to 30°C) to investigate the association between human thermal perception and the corresponding heat flux. Through this experiment, the correlations between heat flux, air temperature, relative humidity, and thermal preferences were analyzed. The high correlation factors (0.90 on average) between heat flux and thermal preferences suggest that heat flux sensors have a high potential to be used as an effective sensing modality in the HITL HVAC operation. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) introduced new opportunities for network aptitude and capability for smart cities and environments due to the easy implementation and to the fastest and the well-organized way to create communication. Conversely, the mobility of nodes during routing is still challenging in such mobile environments. To tolerate the instantaneous adaptation of the integration and the exploitation of MANETs in smart city environments, an original solution has been suggested.

Spatial Relation Expiration Time is used to predict the remaining time that this spatial relation is available.

In effect, city-scale field trials are being conducted by major high-tech companies to explore the capabilities and limitations of vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Initial advances have led to safety enhancing applications like the electronic emergency brake light, cooperative collision avoidance and cooperative adaptive cruise control. In IEEE standard 1609.2, security measures to guarantee the integrity and authenticity of VANET messages are specified.

To demonstrate the feasibility of trajectories as proof for co-presence, we implemented a smartphone application and conducted driving experiments under real-world conditions.

Large-scale IoT systems such as smart cities require significant investment in both equipment and personnel. To maximize return on investment, IoT platforms should support multiple third-party applications and adaptation of infrastructure over time. Realizing the vision of shared IoT platforms demands strong security guarantees. That is particularly challenging considering the limited capability and resource constraints of many IoT devices. In this paper, we present SPEED, an approach to secure erasure with verifiability in IoT. Secure erasure is a fundamental property when it comes to share an IoT platform with other users which guarantees the cleanness of a device’s memory at the beginning of the application deployment as well as at the time of releasing the underlying IoT device. SPEED relies on two security primitives: memory isolation and distance bounding protocol. We evaluate the performance of SPEED by implementing it on a simple bare-metal IoT device belongs to Class-1.

This is achieved through accounting for cache utilization in both the message passing and the computational kernel, where it is demonstrated that the optimal domain decompositions not only depend on the communication and load balance but also on the cache-misses, amongst other factors. In this work we demonstrate that those conclusions may also be extended to more advanced numerical discretizations, based upon Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR).

The protocols behave differently under varying load conditions and transaction characteristics. Further, the invocation period of these protocols can be controlled to improve performance when the overhead tends to become large. The performance of these protocols has been demonstrated using a distributed real-time transaction processing simulator which provides an interactive interface to set parameters, and also has provisions to select from a variety of concurrency control, priority assignment, workload distribution and other protocols.

One possibility, to carry and share the collected data, is in autonomous vehicles systems, which use the Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology. For example, in a Car-to-Parking-Meter or a Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, short-range embedded sensors such as Bluetooth, Cameras, Lidar send the collected data to the vehicle's Electronic Control Unit (ECU) or to a road side gateway for making collaborative decisions and react to the environment's surrounding conditions.

The routing is the important factor for having effective communication between smart vehicles, which need to be addressed smartly. Many factors affect the communication between the vehicles such as topology fragmentation which results in the phenomenon of Local-Maximum-Problem that lead to packet delivery failure. The traditional routing schemes failed to address the problem of the trade-off between Packet-Delivery-Ratio and the high cost, in term of End-to-End-Delay, of packet recovery from the failures that occurs frequently because of Local-Maximum-Problem.

Sensing, processing and transmitting are the main contributors to energy consumption in a video sensor node. Among these, wireless transmissions play a dominant role. An effective way for reducing energy consumption is to adjust the active time duration of node's radio transmission. However, this method has the main drawback that affects streaming quality in terms of throughput and delay. So, one of the big challenges when designing an energy-aware VSN is the trade-off between energy consumption and video streaming quality.

To solve this problem, several dedicated hardware solutions have been proposed for real-time applications. In this work, a novel heterogeneous architecture of an AdaBoost detector is presented. This architecture achieves higher performance while consuming fewer hardware resources. By combining an integrated ARM Cortex-A9 processor with a dedicated accelerator, this architecture can be configured to realize various objects detection by simply loading different parameters. 2-D parallelism is involved in accelerator unit combination which brings more flexibility. This scheme is implemented on Xilinx ZC702 platform, the experiment result shows that 40 QVGA frames per second can be achieved for real-time face detection. The accelerator achieves more than 13 times improvement over the OpenCV implementation on a standalone Cortex-A9 w.r.t execution speed.

Conversely, the scheme of moving computation to data has potential to improve efficiency, especially for the irregular applications that contain graph computing, hash map or matrix multiplication. This paper proposed a near-data processing scheme for the large scale CMPs with hardware message passing support, which we called in-place computation scheme. In the in-place computation scheme, an application's critical irregular data is partitioned into on-chip memory-slices and each slice is managed by an adjacent core, as any other core intends to operate such data, it sends a message to the data owner to process it, rather than fetching the data back for computation by itself. In the paper, we described the programming model, hardware/software requirements and optimization strategies of the in-place computation scheme in details. Simulations show that, compared with conventional implementations, it can improve the performance and energy-efficiency significantly in most cases, due to following factors: 1) It greatly reduces data movements and synchronizations, 2) It decreases core-pipeline stalls and improves efficiency of memory-accesses. © 2016 IEEE.","Chip-multiprocessor; In-place computation; Message passing; Near data processing"

In this paper, we present a novel optimization of SLINK algorithm, GridSLINK, which is an order of magnitude faster than the existing state-of-the-art implementation. The optimization in GridSLINK comes from reduction in number of distance calculations required by SLINK. This reduction is achieved by exploiting spatial locality of data points and using an adaptive gridding technique. GridSLINK is parallelized for distributed memory systems. Scalable performance is achieved for increasing number of compute nodes. The proposed parallel algorithm, dGridSLINK, is benchmarked against the best existing parallel algorithm in literature and found to outperform the latter for all the real datasets considered. dGridSLINK can cluster millions of data points in few seconds/minutes using a small number of processing elements, without compromising the quality of clustering. © 2016 IEEE.","Adaptive gridding; Clustering; Multi-core; Multi-node; Parallel computing; SLINK"

Machine learning has been successfully introduced into SpMT to improve its performance. An appropriate sample set is important for machine learning-based (ML-based) thread partition. Conventionally, heuristic rules-based (HR-based) sample generation approach can not generate adaptive samples, which conform to ML-based thread partition platform and characteristics of source applications. A hybrid sample generation approach is proposed. With this method, we firstly automatically generate samples which are mips codes consisting spawning points (SP) and control quasi-independent points (CQIP) by heuristic rules, then manually adjust the positions of SP and CQIP and rebuild pre-computation slice (p-slice) to obtain better performance for every application. During the implementation of this approach, three measures: bias weighting, reservation of optimal solutions, summary of greedy rules are carried out. In this way, we enhance the adjustment frequency for the subroutine with high called number, achieving a stable improvement of speedups. On Prophet, which is a generic SpMT processor to evaluate the performance of multithreaded programs, Olden benchmarks are used to realize the approach. Experiments show that the approach can obtain better sample sets, which deliver a better performance improvement of about 10% on a 32 core than conventional heuristic-based approach.

One of the main challenges in the scalability of computers hardware is the hierarchy of the memory. Chip-multiprocessors (CMPs) rely on large and multi-level hierarchies of caches to reduce cost of resources and improve systems performance. These multi-level hierarchies are the ones, which also help to solve the issue of limited bandwidth and minimize the latency of the main memory. Almost half of the area of the chip and a large percentage of the system energy is used by caches. One of the main problems limiting the scalability of cache hierarchies is called cache associativity. Caches consume a lot of energy to implement associative lookups. This affects the performance of the system by reducing the efficiency of caches. This paper describes a new design of cache that we called - Adaptive Hashing and Replacement Cache (AHRC). This design has the ability of maintaining high associativity with an advanced method of replacement policy. AHRC can improve associativity and maintain the number of possible locations, where each block is kept as small as possible. Several workloads were simulated on a large-scale CMP with AHRC as the last-level cache. We propose an Adaptive Reuse Interval Prediction (ARIP) scheme for AHRC, which is superior to the NRU scheme that was described by Seznec. Results demonstrate that AHRC has better energy efficiency and higher performance as compared to conventional caches. Additionally, large caches that utilize AHRC are the most suitable in many core CMPs to provide a more significant improvement and scalability than the smaller caches. However, AHRC with a higher-level replacement may lead to loss of energy for workloads that are not sensitive to the policy governing the replacement process. © 2016 IEEE.","AHRC; ARIP; Cache Associativity; CMP; Hashing; Replacement Policy"

Wearable sensors, especially sensors embedded in smartphones, turn to be good data streams for human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. Unfortunately, most of the existing methods are evaluated on small and fixed-size datasets, and lack of data sharing as well as classifiers re-training functions. These issues will lead to the challenge of unadaptable learning when facing problems of volume and variety of data. In order to tackle these problems, this paper proposes a new method with adaptive, interactive, and general-personal-model training components, and data sharing on the cloud. The major advantage of the proposed method is very fast to detect human activities of a new user at the beginning (i.e. deploying a system to a new user) with an acceptable accuracy of detection using the general model. Then, the personal model will help to increase the accuracy of activities detection personally by interacting with users. Another advantage of the proposed method is to share data (e.g. sensory data, models, activities, and user's profiles) among users/apps joined the system. These data will help to increase the accuracy of models timely by re-training periodically. Besides, the method can be used as a human-activity sensor that streams detected human activities to related components of smart-city scheme. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to de-facto datasets as well as state-of-the-art of HAR using smartphones.

The 'smartness' of a smart grid is wasted if major consumption locations, ranging from individual buildings to larger collection of buildings (such as campuses or cities) don't have a comparable level of intelligence. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective tool for integrating the smart grid with future smart buildings. Interest is growing about the need to research the application of MPC to the operation of building systems; however, full-scale MPC concepts have not made it yet into commercially available building energy management systems. Much of the prior published work uses a simplified description of building and systems performance in order to reduce computational complexity.

This would allow a smart building or connected campus of buildings to effectively integrate an overall operational strategy for a future time horizon of 24-48 hours to minimize the energy consumption and cost, enable integration of regional renewable energy sources, and, importantly, consider human factors such as building indoor environmental quality (thermal comfort indoor air quality, etc.).

With the recent advent of the so-called connected objects, today largely present in our surroundings, software applications have an open door to the physical world through sensors and actuators. However, although it offers huge opportunities in many areas (e.g., smart-home, smart-cities, etc. . . ), it poses a serious methodological challenge. Indeed, while classical software applications operate in the well known and delimited digital world, the so-called ambient applications operate in and through the physical world, open and subject to uncertainties that cannot be modeled accurately and entirely. These uncertainties lead the behavior of the ambient applications to potentially drift over time against requirements. In this paper, we propose a framework to estimate the behavioral drift of the ambient applications against requirements at runtime. Methodology. We rely on the Moore Finite State Machines (FSM) modeling framework to specify the ideal behavior an ambient application is supposed to meet, irrespective of the operating environment and the underlying software infrastructure. We then appeal on the control theory and propose a framework to transform the Moore FSM to its associated Continuous Density Hidden Markov Model (CD-HMM) state observer. By accounting for uncertainties through probabilities, it extends Moore FSM with viability zones, i.e. zones where the behavioral requirements of the ambient applications are acceptable. The observation of the execution of a concrete ambient application together with the statistical modeling framework underlying its associated state observer allow to compute the likelihood of an observation sequence to have been produced by the application. The likelihood then gives direct insight into the behavioral drift of the concrete application against requirements. Results. We validate our approach through a concrete usecase in the field of school lighting. The results demonstrate the soundness and efficiency of the proposed approach for estimating the behavioral drift of the ambient applications at runtime. In light of these results, one can envision using this estimation to support a decision-making algorithm (e.g., within a self-adaptive system).","Cyber-physical systems; Drift estimation; Hidden Markov model; Service composition; Ubiquitous computing; Uncertainties"

The opportunistic networks in these scenarios are composed of disconnections, network partitions, high delay and strong influence of human mobility. To cope with these challenges, social-inspired approaches have been proposed considering the structure of networks and personal user features, however, limited studies have explored temporal variations of features and influence of exogenous variables, disregarding adaptive forwarding policies recommended for dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we address these challenges while investigating both, the temperature and the season calendar, as environmental features able to model the behavior of users' mobility and peer contacts. The results showed distinct social and spatiotemporal features characterized by thermal conditions able to affect the network performance. We also identified critical points of temperature able to provide early signals about the network changes. Finally, our results indicate that environmental data are crucial information towards the design of the next generation opportunistic mobile networks. © 2016 IEEE.","critical points; opportunistic networks; social networks"

Thus, in order to achieve the dream of a smart city, special attention was given to the treatment of cities' traffic management problem; especially in junctions which constitute bottlenecks for traffic flow leading to a poor quality of urban mobility. The aim of this study is to examine further the RED approach for traffic lights management recently proposed for the design of an adaptive signal control system In the context of ITL (Intelligent Traffic Lights) systems, based generally on sensors, and communication technologies. Traffic management is a well known problematic in data networks. Thus, several researchers have studied methods for providing congestion avoidance at the gateway called also router. Inspired by advanced technologies in Internet traffic management, we propose a system based on the RED (Random Early Detection) mechanism widely used by routers to avoid congestion. Our contribution consists of the adaptation of this mechanism to the ITS context by applying it for traffic lights management. Our system will certainly contribute to decrease waiting times, fuel consumption and pollution. This paper will present the complete adaptation of the RED algorithm to the context of the intelligent transport systems. In addition, the RED-based design performance is compared with that of the pre-timed model to gain insights between the two systems. © 2015 IEEE.","ITL; ITS; Performance; RED; Road Traffic"

We propose a mechanism that operates in a cognitive radio mode for increasing the channel-reuse rate and decreasing the consumption of redundant channels. The advantage is a heterogeneous-communication interface available through cognitive mechanisms that can recognize different transmission modulation modes. The receiver will get messages through different transmission modulation modes. In this work, we consider vehicles connecting to traffic-congestion computing centers (TCCCs) by vehicle-to-roadside (V2R) communications under a car society. Roadside units serve each segment, and we suppose that every car has a navigation device. We propose an innovative congestion-reducing mechanism that can help vehicles get directions with the help of a navigation device after drivers set the origin location and the destination location. This mechanism can calculate the congestion status of the upcoming segment of road. By tracking roadway segments' status from a point of origin to a destination, our proposed mechanism can handle cross-area car societies. The current study evaluates this approach's performance by conducting computer simulations.

It shows how existing approaches to the study of such experiments fail to effectively address the design and development of information technology within them.

The paper thus asks the question: ""how are urban II prototypes designed?"" In order to answer this question, the paper proposes that ICT within urban infrastructures can be conceptualized as information infrastructures (IIs), and that complex adaptive systems (CAS) provide a useful theoretical framework for examining the mechanisms that drive II design. In using this framework, the importance of facilitation and the intermediary in designing urban II prototypes becomes evident. The critical role of intermediation is illustrated through a case study of the development of an II in Berlin targeted with prototyping a sustainable mobility infrastructure, which integrates electric car-sharing into the public transport system.
