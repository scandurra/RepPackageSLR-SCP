Title,Abstract
The CitySpin platform: A CPSS environment for city-wide infrastructures,"Cyber-physical Social System (CPSS) are complex systems that span the boundaries of the cyber, physical and social spheres. They play an important role in a variety of domains ranging from industry to smart city applications. As such, these systems necessarily need to take into account, combine and make sense of heterogeneous data sources from legacy systems, from the physical layer and also the social groups that are part of/use the system. The collection, cleansing and integration of these data sources represents a major effort not only during the operation of the system, but also during its engineering and design. Indeed, while ongoing efforts are concerned primarily with the operation of such systems, limited focus has been put on supporting the engineering phase of CPSS. To address this shortcoming, within the CitySPIN project we aim to create a platform that supports stakeholders involved in the design of these systems especially in terms of support for data management. To that end, we develop methods and techniques based on Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies for the acquisition and integration of heterogeneous data from disparate structured, semi-structured and unstructured sources, including open data and social data. In this paper we present the overall system architecturewith a core focus on data acquisition and integration.We demon-strate our approach through a prototypical implementation of an adaptive planning use case for public transportation scheduling.

Towards a framework for smart city model based on adaptive capacity,"The paper demonstrates the ongoing research concept focused on Smart City adaptation models' development. The authors provide the research approach, dimensions, indicators and methods to be used in modelling. The framework is based on collecting as much open data as it could be found for detection the level of new technologies' adaptation among citizens and officials. The proposed framework could be of interest to monitor a smart city development at the early and middle stages in various countries. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s)."
A framework for transforming dubai into a smart city,"Smart City is a solution to the increased globalization of cities by managing and applying ICT to all the aspects of the city such as mobility, electricity, water, energy, economy, environment, governance, health, and education to increase the quality of life for city dwellers and the future sustainability. As people started to move from rural areas into cities, cities started to have congestion, traffic, crimes, increased carbon emissions, illiteracy, and unemployment. Cities have to manage these complexities by finding smart solutions. His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum has launched the strategy to transform Dubai into a smart city and to be ready for expo 2020 that could result in road traffic and increased tourism. Other reasons for Dubai to become a smart city are that are the business and real estate boom, because foreign investments are pouring in and many populations are coming to Dubai, so it needs to have sustainability. Dubai is in a state where it requires having sustainable energies and buildings to accept many populations. A framework is a set of principles and guidelines to prepare the right components and people, and taking the right steps and stages to achieve the outcomes. A roadmap is a vision done by stakeholders, of the final outcome of the desired project, and it takes from 10 to 50 years. A roadmap is a plan or strategy intended to achieve a particular goal. This research has studied various smart city initiatives in the world and the numerous frameworks on smart cities. An adaptive framework specifically for Dubai City has been proposed and a roadmap for its implementation has been suggested. This outcome can be used by the Government of Dubai to plan their smart city strategies. © 2017 IEEE."
CityPro: From big-data to intelligent-data; A smart approach,"For a city to be named smart, it has to be intelligently benefiting from the omnipresent systems available to improve life's quality and assure public safety. However, being in the world of Big Data we had to find a way that helps us in maintaining the benefits of this data while reducing its size. That’s why in this paper we focus on transforming Big Data into smart data. To achieve this goal, the work of this research is dedicated to finding the optimal way of storing data in the collaborated surveillance system, CityPro. In its proposed architecture it implied using an adaptation of a federated star-schema like data repository for storage. The repository is opted to store summarized data instead of the huge amounts of data coming from partners, which will help in moving from the nomenclature of Big Data to smart data. To attain this property, we are trying to propose a new technology by creating a global unified profile for each individual in the city, which will facilitate the monitoring of suspects and predict their moves. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

CitySense: Blockchain-oriented Smart Cities,"A smart city is a connected system in which things produce a huge quantity of data. We focused the attention on monitoring the environment quality in urban area by means of a distributed network of small mobile sensors that are devices on the Internet of Things (IoT). Sensors produce digital measurements, useful for investigating and studying the life quality in every part of the city. In our vision, environmental data must be available by everyone and shared with citizens, but it must be unmodifiable. We propose to solve the problem of the sensors data storage and management using a disruptive technology called blockchain. The blockchain responds to the demand of availability and unchangeability and, thanks to the potentiality of smart contracts, makes us able to manage sensor information and implement a control logic. In order to develop the software based on blockchain we chose to apply the SCRUM methodology because of its capabilities of being a flexible, adaptive and iterative methodology. © 2017 ACM."
Citizens as sensors: The cognitive city paradigm,"Intelligent/smart cities have been touted as one of the solutions to the challenges of ever increasing complexities faced by present and future urban environments. Leveraging information technology to allow better demand and supply management of key urban infrastructure system offer immense opportunities for efficiency and quality of service improvements in urban services. In this paper, we argue that implementing sensor networks are a necessary but not sufficient approach to improving urban living. Building on the concept of the cognitive city discussed elsewhere by the authors, this paper proposed an architectural process approach that allows city decision-makers and service providers to integrate cognition into urban processes. Cognition is the ability of a system to learn from previous experiences and adapt its behavior based on them. A cognitive system is able to sense, perceive and respond to changes in the environment and can therefore improve a system's performance by increasing its adaptive capacity. © 2011 IEEE."
