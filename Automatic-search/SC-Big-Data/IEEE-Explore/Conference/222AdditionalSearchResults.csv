However, due to various reasons, they cannot be updated on time. Manual monitoring is required to update. If there is no update, manual update is required, which undoubtedly increases the burden on business personnel. The intelligent age needs to find a time-saving and labor-saving solution to solve this problem. The DIKW (Data Information Knowledge Wisdom) model is the most basic model in the research of information management, knowledge management, etc. The main content of the weather website is the collection of historical data, the summary storage of information, the knowledge processed by machine learning, and the wisdom of decision-making applications. The Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm (NBC) is widely used because of its high classification accuracy and simple model. For this reason, the model is combined with machine learning algorithms and imported into actual meteorological application research, and the NBC algorithm is combined with the weather website. One-month historical update data mining calculates the prior probability, and then the classification result is calculated according to the Python program to capture the data of the day. By recording the future 16 sample data sets using this model for calculation and analysis, 15 pieces of data conform to the results of the model calculation and classification, and the accuracy rate reaches 93.7%. The results show that the higher accuracy of the algorithm classification forecast can promptly remind business personnel, and better guarantee the timely update of tourism products, thereby improving the work efficiency of business personnel, and providing practical application reference value for smart weather service business automation.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00337","Natural Science Foundation of Hainan Province(grant numbers:420MS119); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781236","DIKW model;Naive Bayes;python;crawler;classification prediction;weather website","Analytical models;Machine learning algorithms;Predictive models;Probability;Data models;Naive Bayes methods;Classification algorithms","Bayes methods;data mining;knowledge management;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;travel industry","Naive Bayes Algorithm;weather website tourism products;weather conditions;manual monitoring;manual update;business personnel;DIKW model;Data Information Knowledge Wisdom;information management;knowledge management;historical data;decision-making applications;Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm;high classification accuracy;machine learning algorithms;actual meteorological application research;NBC algorithm;one-month historical update data mining;classification result;future 16 sample data sets;model calculation;algorithm classification forecast;timely update;practical application reference value;smart weather service business automation","","","","19","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is done by overwhelming the target and its surrounding infrastructure with a flood of Internet traffic. The multiple compromised computer systems (bots or zombies) then act as sources of attack traffic. Exploited machines can include computers and other network resources such as IoT devices. The attack results in either degraded network performance or a total service outage of critical infrastructure. This can lead to heavy financial losses and reputational damage. These attacks maximise effectiveness by controlling the affected systems remotely and establishing a network of bots called bot networks. It is very difficult to separate the attack traffic from normal traffic. Early detection is essential for successful mitigation of the attack, which gives rise to a very important role in cybersecurity to detect the attacks and mitigate the effects. This can be done by deploying machine learning or deep learning models to monitor the traffic data. We propose using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms to analyse the traffic patterns and separate malicious traffic from normal traffic. Two suitable datasets have been identified (DDoS attack SDN dataset and CICDDoS2019 dataset). All essential preprocessing is performed on both datasets. Feature selection is also performed before detection techniques are applied. 8 different Neural Networks/ Ensemble/ Machine Learning models are chosen and the datasets are analysed. The best model is chosen based on the performance metrics (DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODEL). An alternative is also suggested (Next best - Hypermodel). Optimisation by Hyperparameter tuning further enhances the accuracy. Based on the nature of the attack and the intended target, suitable mitigation procedures can then be deployed.","","979-8-3503-9826-7","10.1109/IC3I56241.2022.10073271","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10073271","Smart City;DDoS;Cyber Attack;Machine Learning;Deep Neural Networks;Network Security","Deep learning;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Traffic control;Denial-of-service attack;Chatbots","computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Internet;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;security of data;smart cities;software defined networking;telecommunication traffic","attack results;attack traffic;bot networks;DDoS attack SDN dataset;DDoS cyber attacks;deep learning algorithms;deep learning models;degraded network performance;denial-of-service;Internet traffic;network resources;NEURAL NETWORK MODEL;normal traffic;separate malicious traffic;smart city Networks - intelligent detection;total service outage;traffic data;traffic patterns","","","","20","IEEE","22 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Morocco, the waste management is the primary challenge for the competent authority to reduce the amount of solid waste generated and satisfy the environmental regulations. The waste collection and treatment plan is the first pillar to optimize in order to better manage the quantities of waste produced by different industrial activities. Smart technologies were identified as alternative solution having the required qualifications for the creation the smart cities. They haves great potential to increase the efficiency and quality of waste collection. High costs and low efficiency are the two main challenges of smart garbage collection. An inconsequent management leads to resources waste at all levels. For example, the city resources are misused and a colossal amount of gasoline is wasted every day. This problem can be solved by managing and protecting all storage spaces using machine learning technics. A key goal of machine learning is the development of algorithms to make future predictions. Machine Learning Based Automatic Waste Recycling Framework has been proposed to classify and separate materials in a mixed recycling application to improve the separation of complex waste. The main purpose of the present paper is to assess machine learning algorithms used in recycling systems.

According to the characteristics of different network traffic to ensure the full utilization of broadband resources and improve the quality of network service. Due to the wide application of dynamic port number and stream encryption technology, the traditional network traffic classification method based on port number and deep packet inspection is no longer effective. In recent years, machine learning methods can be used to accurately identify categories of network traffic applications by labeled data. However, collecting enough labeled network traffic data is a time-consuming and difficult task, and the distribution of traffic data collected in various networks is different. In order to solve the problem of insufficient labeled samples and domain distribution differences, a network traffic classification method based on domain adaptive migration is proposed in this paper. This paper designs a new domain adaptive method, which reduces distribution differences between domains, makes the distribution of samples under the same category more compact and different application categories more separated. Then migrate the feature extraction module to the target domain. And the unlabeled data and few labeled samples are utilized to jointly classify network traffic applications using a siamese sparse denoising stacked autoencoder.

DDoS is also effectively used to stop services on Internet of Things systems based on the message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. In the system, attackers usually attack brokers who are used to manage data traffic between the issuer and the customer. Several research projects have been undertaken to detect DDoS in the Internet of Things (IoT) using machine learning. However, existing research projects still generally have low detection accuracy in predicting DDoS. This study provides a solution to the above problems by proposing the development of a machine learning model based on Neural Network (NN) to detect DDoS. Furthermore, this study also compared the results of NN predictions with K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The methods used in this study are as follows: 1. Conducting literature studies. 2. Develop both machine learning models. 3. Conduct analysis. Rigorous experiments have been carried out using dataset derived from other research and dataset generated through DDOS simulations in IoT environments. By using the dataset generated through simulation, the results obtained showed that the accuracy of NN is better than KNN, which is 99.99% and 99.82%, respectively.","","978-1-6654-8665-1","10.1109/ICoDSA55874.2022.9862848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9862848","distributed denial-of-service;neural network;k-nearest neighbor","Protocols;Artificial neural networks;Machine learning;Data science;Prediction algorithms;Denial-of-service attack;Internet of Things","computer network security;Internet of Things;nearest neighbour methods;neural nets;queueing theory;transport protocols","attack brokers;low detection accuracy;Neural Network;DDOS simulations;DDoS attack detection system;Distributed Denial-of-Service;computer network;message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol;K-nearest neighbor;machine learning model","","","","18","IEEE","25 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Smart services rely heavily on collecting data and the preferences of users. But on the dark side, the users' information is posed to threat and penetration during transmission or stored far in the clouds. Depending on encryption only is not sufficient if the attacker has strong resources or if the attacker is the service provider (SP) itself. In addition, changing data before sending is not a practical solution in many systems because of the adverse impact on the quality of a main service. This research presented a new idea to address the issue of protection. The proposed method enhanced the privacy and security of users' data without affecting the accuracy of service. The core of the suggested solution relies on a knowledge base of services that are managed by experts. Also, the solution depends on fog nodes to measure the level of security and privacy of users' queries without delay. Moreover, the fog nodes manage contact with SPs. Finally, the proposed method divided the SP into two, one for user queries and the other for user data. The simulation and analytical discussion on a practical case in smart cities demonstrated the superiority of the proposed approach over previous methods in the level of protection by maintaining the quality of services, and the resistance to attacks.","","978-93-80544-47-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10112452","Privacy;Security;IoT;Smart city;Fog","Resistance;Privacy;Data privacy;Machine learning algorithms;Smart cities;Knowledge based systems;Quality of service","cloud computing;computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;smart cities","double-SP method;enhance privacy;fog nodes;main service;service provider;smart cities;smart city applications;smart services;strong resources;suggested solution;user data;user queries;users","","","","28","","4 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The increasing network traffic reflects in the task of identifying IoT attacks and detect malicious data at an early stage. The proliferation of IoT systems comes with the hazard of network attacks such as denial of service (DoS) and spoofing. Lot of experimenter have worked on IDS development using machine learning approaches to rectify the problems outlined above. With the accuracy of computer drills, the non-uniform data can be spotted automatically. Even unknown threats can be detected by machine learning systems due to their generalizability.

Therefore, a comprehensive and efficient solution to this issue is crucial. This paper proposes a scheme for mitigating DDoS attack traffic deployed on an SDN application plane. The framework periodically obtains the traffic statistics of the switch ports and flow tables. After obtaining the traffic characteristics, a machine learning model is used for training. The trained model can identify benign and malicious traffic. After the attack is found, the rules are sent to the switch to control the flow and resist DDoS attacks.

Our objective is to create a system that uses Natural Language Processing to assess client feedback from online purchasing and deliver a ratio of good and bad comments written in Bangla from past customers (NLP). We gathered approximately 6000 comments and views on the product to conduct the study. As classification approaches, we used sentiment analysis, as well as KNN, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. With an accuracy of 94.78 percent, SVM outperformed all other methods.","","978-1-6654-1120-2","10.1109/ICAECT54875.2022.9808003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9808003","Machine learning;NLP;Product Review;kNN;Logistic Regression;Naïve Bayes;Random Forest;Decision Tree;Support Vector Machine","Sentiment analysis;Epidemics;Support vector machine classification;Forestry;Product design;Quality assessment;Electronic commerce","decision trees;Internet;marketing;nearest neighbour methods;online shopping;pattern classification;purchasing;random forests;regression analysis;sentiment analysis;support vector machines","Internet shopping;online product service providers;product quality;natural language processing;online purchasing;NLP;sentiment analysis;support vector machine;product review sentiment classification;machine learning;online marketing;e-commerce firms;Bangladesh;Internet technology;lockdown;COVID-19 epidemic;client feedback assessment;KNN;decision tree;SVM;random forest;logistic regression","","","","13","IEEE","1 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although there have been recent developments with the application of machine learning in this domain, there is still a need for improvement in the performance of already deployed applications. This paper aims to proffer a solution to the question of how to improve the state-of-the-art solutions of machine learning-based intelligent systems for managing the energy efficiency of public buildings as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Gradient Boosting Machine algorithms which include Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Category Boosting (CatBoost), and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) were used to create predictive models of energy consumption of specific public buildings. The best performing model with the minimum root mean squared error of 1.119 was produced by the Light Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm (LightGBM), and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all the methods has been conducted. The evaluation metrics used in this study are Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Coefficient of Determination (R squared). The model could be deployed as an intelligent machine learning-based energy management system for public buildings which could be used as a part of the smart city concept such that public administration could use it to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings to reduce energy consumption and cost. This kind of digital transformation in energy management can further increase the energy efficiency of public buildings and also promote a healthier environment.","","978-1-6654-7914-1","10.1109/AEEES54426.2022.9759759","Sichuan Youth Science and Technology Innovation Team Fund(grant numbers:2017TD0009); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51977025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9759759","energy efficiency;machine learning;smart cities","Adaptation models;Energy consumption;Machine learning algorithms;Smart cities;Buildings;Predictive models;Boosting","building management systems;energy conservation;energy management systems;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;smart cities","energy efficiency;smart cities;electrical energy;machine learning-based intelligent systems;smart city concept;energy consumption;specific public buildings;light gradient boosting machine algorithm;intelligent machine learning-based energy management system;LightGBM;MAE;RMSE;root mean squared error;mean absolute error;R squared;coefficient of determination;public buildings;digital transformation","","1","","10","IEEE","25 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data sharing through cloud for smart cities, collaborative actions, remote activities based on the data at the source, etc., need to be secure and free from masquerading and tampering. In most of the cases the data is pushed into the cloud from access points, sensors, or remote access centers. Preventing the data access and identifying anonymous access to these sensors require an enhanced security mechanism that prevents the inconsistent data to be transferred to the cloud. We propose a blockchain based enhanced security system that protects the data from the access point it leaves for the cloud using a distributed ledger. The consensus mechanism ensures the trust of existing sources during the data transfer from the source to the cloud. The trust generated by the subsequent data blocks with the security hash key ensure the integrity of the data and validity of the actual source. This prevent the illegal access to the data sharing points. We have verified the degree of security offered by our proposed model using informal analysis.

By the employ of machine learning (ML) solution, our performance model further captures the low-level hardware-dependent information, including operator fusion and data layout transformation. Our graph analysis for mainstream models from computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP) and recommendation domains selects total 26 kinds of operators and builds a dataset on the Huawei Ascend 910. With the well-trained model, our open source11Source code available at https://github.com/Huawei-Performance-Model/Ascend-910b performance model finally achieves 15.4 % average error for predicting the execution time of DNN models, and our modeling for memory access and performance bottleneck supports efficient running of DNN models for future systems.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00038","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62102389); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074627","deep learning;performance model;accelerator;operator;computation graph","Deep learning;Analytical models;Technological innovation;Tensors;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Predictive models","computer vision;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;power aware computing","accurate performance analysis;AI accelerator;complex software-hardware interplay;data layout transformation;dedicated accelerators;deep learning systems;deep neural network models;DNN applications;DNN models;graph-level analysis;heterogeneous AI architecture;high-level application performance;low-level hardware-dependent information;machine learning solution;machine learning-enabled Performance Model;mainstream models;memory access;nontrivial dataflow graph analysis;operator fusion;operator performance prediction;operator-based hotspot;recommendation domains selects;software-hardware systems;tensor compiler optimizations;two-stage performance model framework","","","","33","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been instrumental in the growth of smart cities. Smart cities have emerged as a paradigm for urban development which aims to be sustainable, efficient and improve accessibility. However, the limited processing power of IoT devices makes them susceptible to flood-based attacks. Denial of Service attacks can overwhelm the computing resources or network bandwidth of IoT networks. Since IoT devices power critical infrastructure like traffic management in smart cities, adequate defense of such networks from malicious actors is imperative. In this article, the authors propose a framework tailored for detection and mitigation of flood-based attacks in smart city infrastructure. The proposed smart city framework aims to reduce latency of attack detection by using fog computing for feature extraction and security maintenance. It allows scalability by utilizing SDN and fog infrastructure for mitigation of attacks. We have analysed and utilized packet-level features which are excellent for distinguishing between IoT and attack traffic. We have trained and quantitatively compared 5 state-of-the-art supervised machine learning models for attack detection in this paper. We were able to achieve an accuracy of 99.9% on our simulated dataset in attack detection.","","978-1-6654-2390-8","10.1109/GCWkshps52748.2021.9681984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9681984","IoT;Smart City;Machine Learning;Privacy;Flood Attacks","Performance evaluation;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Scalability;Instruments;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic","computer network security;feature extraction;Internet;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence)","flood-based attacks;smart city infrastructure;smart city framework;attack detection;fog computing;fog infrastructure;attack traffic;supervised machine learning models;processing power;computing resources;network bandwidth;IoT networks;IoT devices power critical infrastructure;flood attacks mitigation","","","","17","IEEE","24 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology makes the application of deep learning in various fields possible. The most popular is the application of artificial intelligence to improve urban planning and design. Deep learning has been used in many cities to optimize traffic flow, reduce energy consumption and improve the efficiency of green buildings. Machine learning using multi-layer neurons is called deep learning.

Tunnel traffic classification is the most basic step to maintain network security. The studies on the classification of tunnel traffic is mainly divided into machine learning methods and deep learning methods. However, existing studies only focus on the identification of a single application of the tunnel, assuming that the user only uses one application in the tunnel. Unfortunately, the assumption of a single application is not reasonable in the tunnel. The user may use lots of applications within a time in the tunnel. Moreover, the application traffic is mixed and overlapped in the tunnel. As a solution, we propose TunnelScanner, a novel framework for the identification of two mixed applications in the tunnel. We extracted novel features named maxcum from the tunnel mixed traffic, and then input the extracted features into the traditional machine learning model to train the classifier, to achieve high accuracy and low training overhead. We collected nine types of mixed traffic in three types of tunnels (SSH, SSL, L2TP) to verify the effectiveness of TunnelScanner. The experimental results demonstrate that TunnelScanner is superior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and stability.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781199","Tunnel Traffic Classification;Random Forest;SSL Tunnel","Training;Protocols;Machine learning algorithms;Forestry;Network security;Tunneling;Feature extraction","computer network management;computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;telecommunication traffic","TunnelScanner;tunneling protocols;network security;tunnel traffic classification;machine learning methods;application traffic;mixed applications;deep learning methods","","","","40","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These connected cities have the potential to create a symbiosis of technology and society and revolutionize the cost of living, safety, ecological sustainability, and quality of life of societies on a world-wide scale. Some key components of the smart city construct are connected smart grids, self-driving cars, federated learning systems, smart utilities, large-scale public transit, and proactive surveillance systems. While exciting in prospect, these technologies and their subsequent integration cannot be attempted without addressing the potential societal impacts of such a high degree of automation and data sharing. Additionally, the feasibility of coordinating so many disparate tasks will require a fast, extensible, unifying framework. To that end, we propose the Distributed Smart City framework for Vision, or VDiSC. VDiSC serves as a unified biometric API harness that allows for seamless evaluation, deployment, and simple pipeline creation for heterogeneous biometric software. VDiSC additionally provides a fully declarative capability for defining and coordinating custom machine learning and sensor pipelines, allowing the distribution of processes across otherwise incompatible hardware and networks. VDiSC ultimately provides a way to quickly configure, hot-swap, and expand large coordinated or federated systems online without interruptions for maintenance.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new breakthrough that is bringing the world closer to fully automated processes and systems with sophisticated control. The growth of a nation on the other side of the world leads to an increase in personal automobiles. As a result, metropolitan cities have seen an increase in traffic. A improved traffic management system is needed, therefore. Good and dependable traffic control and bottleneck management may save a lot of money and time. IoT-based ITM sensors are installed in automated cars and smart gadgets to detect, acquire, and send data.. The use of machine learning (ML) may also help to enhance the transportation system. Because of the many issues with current transportation management systems, there is a high prevalence of traffic congestion, delays, and fatalities. Adaptive traffic control based on machine learning and the internet of things is the subject of this study. For the purposes of this proposal, vehicles, infrastructure, and events all play a key role in its design. The design uses a variety of situations to address all of the transportation system's challenges. A machine-learning-based DBSCAN clustering algorithm is included into the system's design to catch any unintentional anomalies.

The preprocessor was tested through experiments that utilized two different datasets, the MNIST dataset and the UCI breast cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) dataset. With both datasets, two identical models were trained and then attacked using the same adversarial points, one with Jangseung protecting it and the other unguarded from attack. In all cases, the protected model out-performed the unprotected model and in the best case scenario, the Jangseung-protected model outperformed the unguarded model by 96.2%. The under-trained, undefended MNIST models had an average accuracy of 53.2%. When Jangseung was present, their identical counterparts had a drastically higher average accuracy at 91.1%. Likewise, in the UCI-Cancer dataset, attack sequences lowered the accuracy of the model to as low as 75.51%, but Jangseung-defended models performed with 88.18% accuracy or better.

However, erasure-coded systems have to update the parity chunk to maintain consistency, when data is updated by applications. This leads to a large amount of I/O overhead, thereby increasing the update latency. Moreover, after updating, the storage systems have to read the latest data and parity deltas randomly scattered in the log, resulting in long recovery time. This paper proposes an efficient erasure-coded data update and recovery approach named MPLR for storage systems. Regarding updates, MPLR initially classifies files into non-read-only and read-only using machine learning prediction, then adopts the suitable schemes to perform updates for a given class of files. For non-read-only files, MPLR performs in-place data updates on data chunk, performs log-based parity updates on parity chunks, and reserves disk space next to the parity chunk. This aims to balance the costs of updates and recovery, and mitigate disk seeks introduced by updates. For read-only files, MPLR also takes hybrid writes for data and parity updates, but it does not reserve the extra disk space for parity chunks. Regarding recovery, parity delta reads are performed on the reserved disk space for non-read-only files, and no parity delta read is involved for read-only files. Based on the shareability of parity delta, MPLR minimizes the amount of the parity deltas that are read in parallel during recovery to reduce the execution time. Extensive experimental results on real-world traces show that, MPLR can successfully improve the update and recovery performance.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00180","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072118,62202108); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074792","Erasure-Coded Storage Systems;Machine Learning Based Hybrid Updates;Seek-Efficient Updates and Recovery;Parity Delta Sharing Based Data Recovery","Costs;Smart cities;File systems;Redundancy;Prototypes;Machine learning;Parallel processing","disc storage;forward error correction;learning (artificial intelligence);storage management","data chunk;data redundancy;data replication;erasure coding;erasure-coded data update;erasure-coded systems;I/O mitigation;in-place data updates;log-based parity updates;machine learning prediction;MPLR;parity chunk;parity delta;reserved disk space;storage systems","","","","18","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For safe and comfortable driving, it would be helpful to detect the driver's attention using a gaze pattern. For this reason, we used Tobii Glass 2 to capture and record the gaze behavior from 10 drivers, each driving ten times on the S-Curve, and used the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm (XGBoost) to identify the essential features that influence the driver behavior. We developed Machine Learning models to predict the driver's gaze behaviors related to their experience. Our results showed the best performance for SVM with 93% accuracy and 94% Precision in classifying the driver performance based on experience while driving on S-Curve. Furthermore, this study established that while at the S-Curve, there was a significant difference between the Experienced and the Novice drivers on the gaze direction pattern. The Novice driver's gaze concentration was often diverted away and took a significant amount of time to return their gaze which is a danger to safe driving. Therefore, detecting the drivers' gaze behavior is vital since failure by the drivers to distribute their attention effectively in driving situations leads to havoc.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00262","Chang'an University(grant numbers:300102249310); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781077","Driver behavior;prediction;Machine Learning;Driver experience;S-Road","Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Roads;Static VAr compensators;Glass;Behavioral sciences;Safety","driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);road accidents;road safety;road traffic;support vector machines","Tobii Glass 2;S-Curve;extreme gradient boosting algorithm;machine learning;driver performance;gaze direction pattern;safe driving;gaze behavior prediction;infrastructure growth;sustainable growth;traffic accidents;driving gaze behavior prediction","","","","27","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, it is possible to employ a uniform platform to automate the services that are delivered. Smart city infrastructure, on the other hand, is susceptible to cyberattacks owing to security flaws in IoT networks. Distributing denial of service (DDoS) and replay assaults, for example, violate the requirements for certification in smart cities. The lack of citations in this part backs up many of the statements it makes. Who needs a citation? Both assaults have the potential to substantially damage smart city infrastructure, which might also cost money and even result in human fatalities. This paper covers the creation of a blended deep- learning algorithm for replay and DDoS intrusion prevention on a growth-oriented smart city platform. This is made possible by combining proven machine-learning approaches with more recent advances in artificial intelligence. We simulate scattered denial of service and replay attacks on three datasets acquired from real-world smart cities to assess the efficacy of the proposed hybrid strategy on environmental, smart river, and smart soil dataset.

The CoRP model includes the following three steps. Firstly, a structural feature extraction module is designed based on meta path by using the similarity metric function to measure the meta path similarity between scholars. Secondly, to overcome the defects that the existing methods usually ignore the attribute information on nodes, three attribute feature presentation functions are constructed to fully utilize the attribute information of scholars in the academic network. In the end, a machine learning classifier which combines the structural similarity and attribute similarity is utilized to learn each attribute feature and complete the task of cooperative relationship prediction. The experimental results reveal that compared with the benchmark method, the proposed method has better performance and interpretability with improvement from 3% to 10% of AUC value for the AMiner academic data set.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781069","heterogeneous network;cooperative relationship;link prediction;meta path;machine learning","Measurement;Smart cities;Semantics;Machine learning;Benchmark testing;Predictive models;Feature extraction","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","structural similarity;attribute similarity;AMiner academic data;heterogeneous academic network;heterogeneous network;link prediction tasks;homogeneous network methods;rich semantic information;relationship prediction model;structural feature extraction module;similarity metric function;meta path similarity;attribute information;attribute feature presentation functions","","","","25","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, with the progress of ICT (Information and Communication Technology), many frailty detection models which use sensors were proposed. However, many of them require very high costs caused by the installation and management of sensors. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a machine learning-based frailty detection model using only electric power consumption data from smart meter, which uses no other devices such as sensors. Also, we examined the feasibility of our model through a case study, in which we have conducted on 24 elderly people. As a result of a cast study, we could detect frailty with 82% accuracy, 77% precision, 84% recall, and 80% f-score for a 2-class classification problem (frailty or non-frailty). The results of our study show that more elderly people can receive frailty diagnoses through smart meters. Moreover, since frailty is a reversible condition that could be restored to a healthy status with early and appropriate intervention, our model has potential to extend the healthy expectancy of the elderly.","","978-1-6654-2099-0","10.1109/DSAA53316.2021.9564127","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9564127","Smart City;Healthcare;Smart Meter;Frailty;Machine Learning","Power demand;Senior citizens;Medical services;Machine learning;Smart meters;Data models;Robustness","biomedical electronics;geriatrics;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;pattern classification;power consumption;smart meters","electric power consumption data;smart meter;elderly healthcare systems;elderly attracted attention;frailty syndrome;frailty detection;elderly people;frailty diagnoses;machine learning;information and communication technology;ICT;sensor installation;sensor management","","1","","26","IEEE","20 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we use a huge amount of data from Reddit users for which we have the results of a Myers-Briggs type indicator test, to predict their type out of their textual input. For this task, we used different machine learning models to implement various techniques to create the final prediction. The methodologies involve evaluating different feature sets to examine if the word group size of the single features and the overall size of the feature sets has a significant influence on the outcomes. Eventually, different models were trained and evaluated on a unified training and test set to assess which model performs better with the proposed computational linguistic problem.

Recent advances in ML methods make it possible to handle the huge amount of complex data, enable fast processing, robustness by decentralization, and scalability of real-world systems.

It also demonstrates that rate of data advancement out of multiple sources is incredibly quick, while hacking tools as well as techniques are also developing at a rapid pace. Machine Learning techniques identify network intrusions and threats by forecasting hazard utilizing data training. The demand for the internet is growing by the day, raising concerns about network security.

It is important to identify video traffic to realize effective network resource management and quality of service (QoS) provisioning. With the popularity of traffic encryption, most traffic identification methods use the following types of features: statistical values or sequences of packets length and packets interval, header fields of the transport layer and its underlying protocols, features of TLS handshake protocol or raw binary data directly. Numerous studies have shown that video traffic can be identified in scenarios where the traffic is encrypted. However, most current methods do not generalize well enough in unknown heterogeneous network environments. In this paper, we propose an innovative feature, namely Response Time Distribution (RTD). We subtly extract the response time of the server and client, which remains relatively stable even in network scenarios with different network qualities, as the original input features, and select the popular tree model with excellent performance as the classification model. The results of an extensive experimental study on several open datasets and real-world traffic datasets show the proposed method is sufficient to resist the complexity of an unknown heterogeneous network environment.

With the rapid development of AI and big data, the input vector in SpMV becomes more and more sparse in many application fields. Especially in some graph analysis calculations, the sparsity of the input vector will change with the running of the program. At this time, the optimal SpMV kernel may be different, and a single SpMV kernel can no longer meet the acceleration requirements. In this paper, we propose a decision tree-based adaptive SpMV framework, named DTSpMV, that can automatically select appropriate SpMV kernels based on different input data in iterations of graph computation. Based on the analysis of computational patterns and serial and parallel algorithms, we encapsulate six SpMV cores within the proposed framework. We explore machine learning-based kernel selectors in terms of both accuracy and runtime overhead. Experimental results on NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU show that our adaptive framework achieves the arithmetic average performance improvement of 60% compared to the state-of-the-art SpMV kernel benchmark, and the average ratio of the runtime prediction overhead of the framework to the total computing overhead is 1.9%.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074875","Adaptive framework;GPU computing;Graph analysis;Machine learning;SpMV","Runtime;Machine learning algorithms;Smart cities;Scientific computing;Graphics processing units;Benchmark testing;Decision trees","Big Data;decision trees;graph theory;graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;matrix multiplication;parallel algorithms;parallel architectures;parallel processing;sparse matrices;vectors","adaptive framework;appropriate SpMV kernels;big data;computational patterns;core algorithms;decision tree-based adaptive SpMV framework;different input data;graph analysis calculations;graph computation;input vector;large-scale scientific computing;machine learning-based kernel selectors;named DTSpMV;optimal SpMV kernel;parallel algorithms;real-world applications;serial algorithms;single SpMV kernel;SpMV cores;state-of-the-art SpMV kernel benchmark;total computing overhead","","","","21","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing FL algorithms still fall short of expectations in unsupervised learning and Non-iid data, which are two major challenges that limit the applicability and accuracy. For example, the lack of data labels or skewed feature distributions leads to loss of representativeness of the model, at the same time, tagging client data will increase a lot of costs in real application scenarios, therefore, supervised federated learning greatly limits the applicability of FL. In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised FL algorithm FedCO. In particular, at the parameter aggregation phase, we apply the momentum update queue to improve the training performance, enhance the model accuracy, and lower the labeling costs. At the local client training phase, the common queue that could be regarded as a big dictionary solve the data heterogeneity.

The P2P approach requires trust among peers in addition to serious cooperation. These requirements are still an open problem for this approach and its methods. In this paper, we propose an effective solution to this issue by creating a manager for the peers' reputation called R-TTP. Each peer has a new query. He has to evaluate the cooperated peer. Depending on the received result of that evaluation, the main peer will send multiple copies of the same query to multiple peers and then compare results. Moreover, we proposed another scenario to the manager of reputation by depending on Fog computing to enhance both performance and privacy. Relying on this work, a user can determine the most suitable of many available cooperating peers, while avoiding the problems of putting up with an inappropriate cooperating or uncommitted peer. The proposed method would significantly contribute to developing most of the privacy techniques in the location-based services.

This study employs an autoregression model using Poisson distribution in predicting the COVID-19 future cases, namely the positive and recovery number. We compare the Poisson Autoregression with several well-known forecasting methods, namely ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, BATS, and Prophet. This study found that Poisson Autoregression could create an accurate prediction with MAPE below 20% and tend to follows the actual data for the next 8 to 14 days to the future.

Thus, this paper integrate mobile edge computing with blockchain system to design a double-layer mining service offloading mechanism, allowing the edge nodes and neighboring vehicles to form a cooperative mining network and collaboratively participate in mining process with specific offloading rates. The first layer uses Asynchronous Advantage Actor-critic (A3C) algorithm to efficiently offload partial mining task from the task vehicle to the road side unit (RSU), and the second layer applies double auction to specifically obtain the offloading rates from RSU to multiple service vehicles.

A Road network is the backbone of any country’s development structure. The free flow of traffic on the highways is vital for better mobility and transportation. These problems necessitate the development of smarter technologies focused on the Internet of Things, which recognize real-time data in the monitored area and analyze urban transportation flow in a smart city road. For a variety of road users, including commuters, private vehicle drivers, and the public transportation system, reliable traffic flow information is critical. This data would aid passengers in choosing the best mode of transportation, improving road flows, reducing noise, and reducing traffic congestion. The proposed system provides solutions to these problems partly. This system predicts the congestion in the road traffic and provides information ahead of time. The importance of traffic congestion prediction has grown in tandem with the rapid development of Smart Transportation Networks for convenient transportation.

For such applications, it is important to be able to perform split-second calculations that provide specific information on driver behavior. To this purpose, the use of artificial intelligence is of crucial importance, since it specifically allows the classification of a driver's style in fractions of a second while he is driving. In this work, two models of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) were trained through a Tiny Machine Learning approach using two different datasets. The first one is obtained using only a 3D accelerometer and a gyroscope, while the second also includes data from On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) port in which data are extracted directly from the Engine Control Unit (ECM). The two systems were compared by carrying out an efficiency analysis which led to important results in terms of optimization.

To better monitor cryptocurrency-based cybercrime, it is essential for a deeper understanding of the patterns that exist in Bitcoin transactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework consisting of empirical analysis and machine learning-based analysis for studying three typical categories of Bitcoin addresses from a dynamic perspective of subgraph evolution. Specifically, we collect 22,001 continuous blocks to build a Bitcoin transaction graph and extract subgraphs from the constructed graph for each address in different periods. In the empirical analysis, we have several important findings from three perspectives. While in the machine learning-based analysis, we propose a 110-dimensional feature set for classification tasks among these three types of Bitcoin addresses, where decision tree, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and random forest are applied. The experimental results illustrate that metrics of all classifiers can achieve 0.88, and the highest accuracy rate reaches 0.95 in the random forest classifier.

To this aim, an end-to-end solution based on ultra Reliable and Low Latency (uRLLC) networks is proposed together with an innovative ML-based approach that uses SHM systems information to detect critical issues in structures. The unprecedented level of reliability offered by uRLLC networks together with the efficient ML modeling capabilities allow to efficiently propagate an alarm message in case of emergency. Referring to the 5G vision, the proposed SHM system can thus be considered depending on the operational scenario: in the case of data collection and processing from sensors, considering the high number of sensors installed, it can refer to the massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) context; vice-versa, during a safety critical situation e.g., during an earthquake or under structural problems, or immediately after the event, the use case requires high reliability, connectivity, and sometimes low latency, i.e. uRLLC.","2770-7679","978-1-6654-6250-1","10.1109/FNWF55208.2022.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10056667","5G&beyond;Machine Learning;Structural Health Monitoring;mMTC;uRLLC;Smart City","5G mobile communication;Image edge detection;Urban areas;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Network architecture;Sensor systems;Safety","5G mobile communication;condition monitoring;learning (artificial intelligence);machine-to-machine communication;structural engineering;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication scheduling","critical situations;edge-based Machine Learning-enabled approach;efficient ML modeling capabilities;high reliability;innovative ML-based approach;Low Latency networks;massive Machine-Type Communications;public protection actions;public safety service;safety critical situation e.g;SHM system;SHM systems information;Structural Health Monitoring systems;structural problems;ultra Reliable;uRLLC networks","","","","30","IEEE","8 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the traffic anomaly detection of electric power industrial control becomes the first step to ensure the safety of the peripheral network. Currently, the traffic anomaly detection system of electric power industrial control based on machine learning has the problems of low computing efficiency and weak representation ability. To solve the problem of low efficiency in traditional deep learning, the deep belief network (DBN) is used to extract the non-linear features of data, which can improve the time efficiency to a certain extent. To solve the problem that the representation ability of traditional machine learning is weak, long short term memory network (LSTM) is used to improve the representation ability of traditional shallow machine learning.

Information and technology, digital operations use, monitoring, and interconnection, amongst other things. The section that follows examines various urban planning concerns, either administration or expansion. Utilizing diverse technologies effectively is made possible by innovative information about towns or an answer to a question concerning high-quality public infrastructure. An innovative method of managing networks is the Software Defined Network (SDN) architecture. Unlike switches in a conventional network computing environment, changes in SDN do not process inbound sachets in the similar means. If no inbound packets are identified after searching the linking tables, they are passed to the control system, the SDN’s operating system, for processing. A Spread Denial of Service (DoS) outbreak poses the biggest risk to the cyber security of an SDN network.The system or application layers of the disease-ridden devices connected to the system will be the target of the attack. The approach for determining whether incoming packets are contaminated or not is clever machine learning-based, and it is proposed in this paper.

Bike-sharing has proven to be an essential mode of transportation and a cornerstone of smart city initiatives. To ensure that bike-sharing service providers can provide an optimal experience to their customers, it is crucial to have accurate information about the total number of bikes available at each station, as imbalances caused by bike shortages can negatively impact the service. While many previous studies have used machine learning techniques to predict demand, few have addressed how these models make their predictions.This study focuses on developing explainable and interpretable models for predicting the total number of bikes. We employ a range of regression methods, including Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), to accurately forecast the distribution of bikes in a bike-sharing service. Our approach uses Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model selection, validation, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to provide a clear and transparent interpretation of the model predictions.To evaluate the models, industry-standard metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R2 Score were used. The report showed an outstanding average R2 Score of 99%, demonstrating the efficacy of the models in accurately predicting the total number of bikes in a bike-sharing service.

However, some features of this application are still carried out semi-automatically, one of which is the road damage classification feature. This causes long working time. Classification of road damage itself needs a visual assessment by humans. Therefore, a solution is needed in the form of a machine learning-based road damage classification system that can help users visually assess road damage. The system uses the supervised learning method to build a classification model. The system still requires a visual assessment by the user to validate the system classification results.

As many HDLSS datasets are very difficult to be collected, their missing values raise many issues and reduce reliability on the datasets to solve a domain and an organizational problem. To address the issues of the missing values in HDLSS datasets, we propose an Ensemble-Based Weight-Learning (EBWF) framework. Given HDLSS datasets and available Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, the EBWF framework is an automated pipeline that can generate the best imputed dataset. To support the EBWF framework, we develop a novel Record Probability Weight Learning (RPWL) imputation algorithm that combines the data record probability calculation from each ML classifier and weight learning computations among all the ML classifiers to impute the missing values in the dataset. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct an experimental case study and evaluation on a survey dataset, i.e., 212 international travelers in Houston for assessing sexual risk-taking behaviors, as a pilot study, where Houston is a critical transit point frequented by international visitors. Based upon the travelers' survey data, where the survey records' missing rate is in the range of 10% to 70%, and the imputed dataset generated by our approach, we show that the classification performance delivered by our framework and algorithm outperform the other baseline approaches'.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781245","high-dimension low-sample size dataset;ensemble-based and weight-learning imputation algorithm;missing values","Chemical industry;Machine learning algorithms;Pipelines;Organizations;Machine learning;Probability;Classification algorithms","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability;statistical analysis","feature dimensions;international travels;Ensemble-Based Weight-Learning framework;given HDLSS datasets;EBWF framework;imputed dataset;novel Record Probability Weight Learning imputation algorithm;ML classifiers;survey dataset;212 international travelers;survey records;imputing missing values;high-Dimension Low-Sample Size datasets","","","","20","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One useful set of such data is movement data, which can readily be obtained via GPS or motion-detection sensors, and which can be used to create models of user movement. One relevant application task based on this type of data is destination prediction, where movement data are used to form highly customized models that can forecast intended user destinations based on partially observed trajectories. In this work, we present a two-stage predictive model for destination prediction and Time-To-Destination (TTD) estimation using movement trajectories and contextual information. Our two-stage approach uses a Transformer-based architecture to predict an intended destination and a regression model to estimate how many steps must be traversed before a destination is reached. We showcase experimental results on various trajectory datasets and show that our proposed approach is able to yield significant destination prediction improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods and can also produce accurate TTD estimates.","2687-8860","978-1-6654-8561-6","10.1109/ISC255366.2022.9922593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9922593","Destination prediction;transformer;deep learning;smart city;machine learning","Smart cities;Estimation;Predictive models;Transformers;Multitasking;Data models;Trajectory","data mining;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;smart phones","movement trajectories;Transformer-based architecture;intended destination;regression model;significant destination prediction improvements;context-aware Destination;Time-To-Destination Prediction;machine learning;rapid adoption;Internet-connected devices;smart phones;smart cars;intelligent systems;useful set;movement data;motion-detection sensors;user movement;relevant application task;highly customized models;user destinations;partially observed trajectories;two-stage predictive model;Time-To-Destination estimation","","","","29","IEEE","26 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fog computing plays a crucial role in providing faster response time and improving network traffic by reducing latency time while executing any kind of task. The main purpose of fog computing is to reduce the burden of the cloud with low latency in a distributed manner. However, sometimes due to some issues, Fog computing has failed to provide adequate and accurate results that reduce effectiveness and quality in performance operations. For this reason, Machine learning (ML) can be used to increase the speed and transmission processes of data through Fog nodes. It helps in improving the architectural series of Fog nodes through real-time processing and communication processes that can be developed according to the user's expectations. This paper tried to present a comprehensive review of the role of Machine Learning in Fog computing by exploring the latest adaptation of ML techniques in some key aspects of Fog (Resource management, security, and Computational enhancement).","","978-1-6654-2577-3","10.1109/ICONAT53423.2022.9726114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9726114","Fog Computing;Machine Learning;Internet of Things (IoT);Cloud Computing","Performance evaluation;Cloud computing;Transportation industry;Training data;Machine learning;Security;Servers","cloud computing;computer centres;Internet;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation","fog nodes;fog computing;machine learning;faster response time;analytical approach;network traffic improvement;latency time reduction;resource management;computational enhancement","","2","","55","IEEE","10 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, single-threaded optimization algorithms can no longer meet the needs of big data applications. When a single machine is trained, it will face the problem of insufficient memory and limited computing capacity. Therefore, distributed algorithms have been proposed to solve big data classification, and have received much attention. Particularly, distributed gradient descent (GD) is a widely-used algorithm for solving big data problem. However, distributed algorithms based on GD always converge slowly and suffer from expensive time in the training process. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel fast distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm for big data classification in this paper. By formulating the original optimization problem as a series of subproblems for classification in each machine. In particular, we exploit a fast stochastic method combined with the Nesterov acceleration method for sub-problem optimization in parallel to improve the convergence speed, and thus reduce the training time. The experimental results on some public and benchmark data sets show that our proposed distributed algorithm can converge faster with the competitive accuracy performance compared with distributed GD-based methods, which is suitable to big data classification.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00251","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61806096); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781079","Big Data;Gradient Descent;Stochastic Gradient Descent;Nesterov Acceleration","Training;Machine learning algorithms;Smart cities;Big Data;Benchmark testing;Classification algorithms;Distributed algorithms","Big Data;distributed algorithms;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;stochastic processes","fast distributed stochastic gradient descent;big data classification;big data environment;single-threaded optimization algorithms;big data applications;distributed algorithm;distributed gradient descent;big data problem;stochastic gradient descent algorithm;distributed GD-based methods","","","","24","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wheatman et al. [11] present Runtime Assurance for Distributed Intelligent Control Systems (RADICS) that extends the Simplex architecture [9] to provide runtime assurance for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) being controlled by machine learning al-gorithms. RADICS can thus allow designers to guarantee some minimum level of system performance via a safety controller while simultaneously allowing for greater average performance via an artificial intelligence (AI) controller. Existing implementations of RADICS have focused on simulated applications such as vehicular traffic control using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) [5] and Flow [12] environments. The aim of this project is to implement RADICS in a physical environment in order to investigate and understand the limitations and challenges of physical deployments. We have selected a water treatment testbed as the application to conduct this evaluation. As a demonstration at ICCPS, we hope to use this testbed deployment to study the impact of real-world issues such as communication latencies, sensor failures, and incomplete information on the RADICS runtime assurance system. We also plan to extend the physical testbed into a hardware-in-the-loop smart city environment where the fidelity of the physical testbed will complement the scalability and flexibility of simulated components. This will allow further evaluation of assurance capabilities such as RADICS before they are deployed in the real world to ensure the safe and reliable operation of intelligent CPS. This work�s novel contributions include an extension of RADICS towards real-world use in cyber-physical systems, analysis of problems inherent to the shift to physical domains, and the introduction of an ensemble-like method for calculating confidence in the RADICS white box monitor.","","978-1-6654-0967-4","10.1109/ICCPS54341.2022.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9797627","Autonomous Systems;Safe Control;Assured AI;Reinforcement Learning","Runtime;Uncertainty;Smart cities;System performance;Scalability;Machine learning;Cyber-physical systems","control engineering computing;distributed control;intelligent control;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic control;safety-critical software;security of data;sensors;software architecture;software fault tolerance;traffic engineering computing","runtime assurance for distributed intelligent control systems;physical deployments;testbed deployment;RADICS runtime assurance system;physical testbed;hardware-in-the-loop smart city environment;assurance capabilities;intelligent CPS;RADICS white box monitor;safety-critical CPS;machine learning;ML decisions;system performance;safety controller;artificial intelligence controller;vehicular traffic control;ICCPS;physical environment;intelligent cyber-physical systems","","","","12","IEEE","24 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this issue, our method relies on Clark's generalized gradients to derive local Lipschitz constants and interval arithmetic to effectively numerically validate existing methods for which the correctness of the results cannot be guaranteed. On this basis, extensive experiments are conducted to compare the Lipschitz constant results produced by our interval algorithm with previous methods for different parameter settings.

All our everyday transit decisions are based on oriented paths from A to B in graph topology without us consciously realizing that. So why do we still look at transportation domain data as transaction data, pushing them into relational databases and losing graph analytics opportunities given to us for free? Let's leverage the full potential of transportation data with graph theory, state-of-the-art graph databases, and fast graph algorithms. The paper aims to propose the usage of a modern NoSQL graph-oriented database in the transportation domain. Our goal is to create a transportation knowledge graph: a network of real-world interconnected entities organized in layers. Layers of data from various transportation domains are linked together following the geographical attributes of nodes mapped to the open-street map layer. The ability to see multiple transportation data in one interconnected network is crucial for our next analytical stage. Knowledge graph structure encourages us to analyze the system and solve centrality, pathfinding, or similarity challenges. To demonstrate the application of our approach, we use the PageRank algorithm to explore geographical heat spots based on start and end rides data from student carsharing Uniqway.

In order to solve this optimization problem we proceed in two steps. In the first step we transform the global real optimization problem depending on $W, G$ into two quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems (QUBO) depending on $W$ and $G$ respectively. In the second step we use an alternative strategy between the two QUBO problems corresponding to $W$ and $G$ to find the global solution. The running of these two QUBO problems on D-wave 2000Q need to use an embedding to the chimera graph of D-wave 2000Q, this embedding is limited by the number of qubits of D-wave 2000Q.

Recently, as the SSL/TLS encryption protocols are widely used in modern Internet environment, how to identify the encrypted traffic become a big challenge. The traditional payload-based methods are usually used to identify the unencrypted traffic, but is no longer effective for the encrypted traffic. To solve the enrypted traffic identification problem, researchers tried to use machine learning methods to model the flow features of encrypted traffics and have made some progress. However the identification accuracy is still not high as these methods usually use the high-level hand-designed features which may loss a lot of important information. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we design PEAN - a Packet-level End-to-end Attentive Network for encrypted traffic identification. PEAN uses the information such as raw bytes and length sequence as the model input rather than using the traditional hand-designed features. Then, we use an unsupervised network traffic pre-training model to better model the traffic bytes. A self-attention mechanism is also designed to better learn the deep relationship among traffic packets. Experiments on a real trace set demonstrate the effectiveness of PEAN.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00061","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3300200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072451); FDCT(grant numbers:0015/2019/AKP); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS(grant numbers:2019349); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781054","Encrypted Traffic Identification;Cyber Security;Traffic Classification","Training;Protocols;Smart cities;Telecommunication traffic;Machine learning;Transformers;Internet","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","PEAN;packet-level end-to-end attentive network;encrypted traffic identification;enrypted traffic identification problem;cybersecurity;TLS encryption protocols;SSL encryption protocols;Internet environment;machine learning methods;flow features;unsupervised network traffic pretraining model;deep relationship","","1","","21","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In batch FPMM, the user aims to compute multiple desired matrix multiplications from two public libraries which are stored across all workers. Batch FPMM requires that colluding workers cannot obtain the indexes of all desired ma-trices in the two public libraries (i.e., privacy constraint). In this paper, we first propose the Bath fullY privatE schemE (BYEE) to encode multiple desired matrix multiplications together based on the construction of bilinear complexity. We then perform a solid theoretical analysis to prove the privacy and decodability of BYEE. Multi-aspect analysis and extensive simulation results illustrate that BYEE can significantly reduce the computation latency than state-of-the-art schemes that do not jointly encode multiple desired matrix multiplications, especially when the number of desired matrix multiplications and the number of colluding workers are large.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00112","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62072321,61972272); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074729","Coded computing;distributed matrix multiplication;private information retrieval;colluding workers","Privacy;Analytical models;Simulation;Computational modeling;Linear regression;Machine learning;Solids","computational complexity;data privacy;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix multiplication;regression analysis","batch FPMM;batch Fully Private distributed Matrix Multiplication problem;batch Fully Private scheme;Bath fullY privatE schemE;BYEE;coded distributed Matrix Multiplication;distributed computing;distributed machine learning;multiple desired matrix multiplications","","","","21","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we aim to explore HR estimation techniques that are more suitable for lower-power and resource-constrained embedded devices. More specifically, we seek to design techniques that could provide high-accuracy HR estimation with low-frequency PPG sampling, small model size, and fast inference time. First, we show that by combining signal processing and ML, it is possible to reduce the PPG sampling frequency from 125 Hz to only 25 Hz while providing higher HR estimation accuracy. This combination also helps to reduce the ML model feature size, leading to smaller models. Additionally, we present a comprehensive analysis on different ML models and feature sizes to compare their accuracy, model size, and inference time. The models explored include Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support vector machines (SVM), and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Experiments were conducted using both a widely-utilized dataset and our self-collected dataset. The experimental results show that our method by combining signal processing and ML had only 5 % error for HR estimation using low-frequency PPG data.

In practice, the matrix sizes are usually too small to make full use of GPU resources in many applications. To this end, previous work has attempted to batch small GEMMs by designing a CUDA core to process multiple GEMMs simultaneously. It divides the GEMM into multiple tiles, and then process a tile in a thread block. However, the approach only processes one tile per thread block and allocates the number of thread blocks based on the size of the largest matrix in the batch. It will make some thread blocks and threads idle. In this paper, we propose a batching strategy to batch small GEMMs with the consideration of several factors, including tile number, block number, and block size. We process multiple tiles in a thread block. Different tiles may need different block size and block number, we select the optimal scheme adaptively according to the hardware resources occupancy. Our proposed strategy achieves the performance improvement of batched GEMM by improving GPU occupancy. The experimental results show that our batching strategy can achieve about 1.7X speedup on average over the MAGMA and about 1.2X performance improvement on average over the state-of-the-art L-gemm.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00143","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672438); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074657","GEMM;GPU;Batching","Chemistry;Scientific computing;Graphics processing units;Machine learning;Signal processing;Parallel processing;Hardware","graphics processing units;matrix multiplication;parallel architectures","adaptive batching strategy;batched GEMM;block number;different block size;different tiles;general matrix multiplication;largest matrix;matrix multiplications;matrix sizes;multiple GEMMs;multiple tiles;signal processing;state-of-the-art L-gemm;thread block;tile number","","","","27","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Businesses substantially rely on the efficiency of these processes to maintain the quality of services for their customers and wish to ensure that an executing business process is progressing in the desired manner. Although process mining techniques provide adequate information about the process execution, it is vital to maintain the quality of business processes through an automated process prediction system that analyses and provides constructive feedback for process improvement. Techniques in the literature can predict the future outcome of a business process, but they lack empirical information about the behaviour of an executing process instance as compared to the optimum process model. In this paper, we have proposed an online process prediction framework using features generated through process mining techniques. We used a heuristic miner algorithm to discover the process model and performed conformance analysis to generate features presenting the contextual behaviour of the process instance.

To ease the implementation of EVEC, we propose a fine-grained EV management approach to jointly provide parking guidance for EVs and control their charging/discharging power in parking lots. We formulate a bilevel optimization problem where the top-level problem optimizes the matching between EVs and parking lots from the perspective of computation offloading, and the bottom-level problem optimizes the control of EV charging/discharging power from the view of power networks. We transform the bilevel optimization problem into a single-level form, which is a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, and we further tackle it by linearization techniques.

The artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) will be pervasive and of key relevance across the security technology stack and architecture in the 6G networks. Despite the advantages of the 6G networks, sophisticated cyberattacks can disrupt the operation of 6G critical infrastructures and associated services. In this paper, we present a novel methodology to create a federated cyber testbed as a service (FCTaaS) that can be offered as a ubiquitous cloud service. Due to the widespread usage of Machine Learning (ML) in critical decision processes of 5G/6G resource management and their applications, there is an exponential growth in cyberattacks to maliciously manipulate the ML algorithms and consequently influence their decision process in favor of the attackers. Currently, there are many isolated cyber testbeds; however, little research has focused on methods to automatically build a federated cyber testbed in general and especially in 6G testbeds. In this paper, we show how to use the FCTaaS services can be used to seamlessly compose a federated cyber testbed that allows researchers to experiment with and evaluate different algorithms to implement different algorithms to conduct data analytics, cybersecurity, and resilient algorithms. In particular, we will show how the FCTaaS can be used to develop highly efficient and accurate federated learning algorithms that can tolerate a wide range of attacks against ML algorithms such as data poisoning and ML model attacks.","2161-5330","979-8-3503-1008-5","10.1109/AICCSA56895.2022.10017506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10017506","5I6G;resource federation;testbed;security;Blockchain;federated cyber testbed;federated learning","6G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Smart buildings;Federated learning;Smart cities;Reliability engineering;Data models","6G mobile communication;cloud computing;computer crime;data analysis;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","6G critical infrastructures;6G networks;artificial intelligence;critical decision processes;cyberattacks;cybersecurity;data analytics;FCTaaS;federated 6G testbed;federated cyber testbed as a service;federated learning;machine learning;ML;security technology stack;ubiquitous cloud service","","2","","54","IEEE","20 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such precision is insufficient for actual security requirements, especially when the image steganography payload is small. To further improve the precision for steganalysis, we propose a residual based CNN model with channel attention mechanism and an innovative pre-processing activation strategy that outperforms previous works in classification precision. Our CNN adopts SRM (Spatial Rich Models) to get rich features and utilizes depth wise separable convolution and Squeeze-and-Excitation attention module to build a CNN with residual structure. In addition, there are two linear fully-connected layers at the end as classifiers. We test our model with WOW and S-UNIWARD steganography at 0.2bbp and 0.4bbp payloads on BOSSbase 1.01 dataset. Our model out-performs previous works, including GBRAS-Net, YEDROUDJ-Net, ZHU-Net, and five others, in terms of classification precision with these four configurations, showing an even more significant precision advantage in the small payload.

Neu-ral Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) combines Fictitious Self-Play (FSP), a popular game-theoretic model, with machine learning to approximate Nash equilibrium without domain knowledge. In two-player zero-sum game, when both partially informed agents update their strategies simultaneously, for each agent, the environment is unstable and partially observable. For one thing, the instability of environment brings error in approximate best response generated by reinforcement learning algorithm. For another, it is necessary to explore more about the opponent's strategy. To solve the problems mentioned above, we propose a new reinforcement learning framework named Expected Average Regret Minimization (EARM), which can approximate better best response by estimating expected average regret and different regret minimizer. In this framework, we propose a new regret minimizer called Temperature Regret Matching (TRM) to control the exploration degree flexibly. Then we propose a novel algorithm EARM-FSP by combining EARM with FSP, which solves the slow convergence problem in NFSP. EARM-FSP converges faster and reaches a better local optima in imperfect information games on OpenSpiel, e.g., Kuhn Poker, Leduc Poker and Liar's Dice.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00261","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U20A20161); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074743","Reinforcement learning;Theory game;Imper-fect information game;Fictitious self-play","Machine learning algorithms;Games;Reinforcement learning;Nash equilibrium;Minimization;Approximation algorithms;Transmission line measurements","game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);reinforcement learning","approximate Nash equilibrium;approximating;Average Regret Minimization;different regret minimizer;domain knowledge;EARM-FSP converges;imperfect information game;neu-ral Fictitious Self-Play;NFSP;novel algorithm EARM-FSP;opponent;partially informed agents;partially observed players;popular game-theoretic model;real-world games;reinforcement learning algorithm;reinforcement learning framework;Temperature Regret Matching;two-player zero-sum game","","","","20","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design has been proposed to implement the traditional software-based Spiking Neural Net-works (SNN) on hardware. However, a major challenge that this SNN based hardware face is the efficient on-chip communications between the neurons. Since SNN has lots of multicast messages to be communicated among the layers, traditional on-chip routing techniques are not sufficient.

As a result, the definition of anomalous and normal data can vary over time and machine learning models may need to be re-trained incrementally. This problem is known as concept drift, and it has often been ignored by anomaly detection systems, resulting in significant performance degradation. In addition, the statistical distribution of past data often tends to repeat itself, and thus old learning models could be reused, avoiding costly retraining phases on new data, which would waste computational and energy resources. In this paper, we propose a hybrid anomaly detection system for streaming data in smart environments that accounts for concept drift and minimize the number of machine learning models that need to be retrained when shifts in incoming data distribution are detected. The system is multi-tier and relies on two different concept drift detection modules and an ensemble of anomaly detection models.

However, the existing machine learning methods require manual features and cannot adapt to the newly generated traffic patterns. Deep learning methods are capable of learning features from the raw traffic sequences automatically but will increase the calculation costs. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Mobile Encrypted Traffic Classification with Markov Chains and Graph Neural Network (MEMG). We use the Markov chains to mine the hidden topological information of the flow. Then we build the flow graph structure on this basis, add the sequence information of traffic in the node feature in the graph. We also design a Graph Neural Network-based classifier to learn the topological and sequential features from the graph. The classifier can map the graph structure to the embedding space, and classify different graph structures by embedding vector differences. We have done comprehensive experiments on both the real-world dataset and the public dataset. The real-world dataset contains the traffic of 29 commonly used mobile encrypted applications collected by us recently, and the total number of traffic exceeds 116,000.

Furthermore, the rapid development of machine learning models for computer vision now presents novel opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) combinations in various application scenarios. However, challenges remain in supporting low-latency video streaming from distributed mobile IoT devices under dynamic network environments, and overcoming video data quality degradation that results from weather “noise”, which reduces the accuracy of AI-based data analyses such as object detection. In this paper, we propose a live video stream processing system for supporting intelligent services that integrates the following features. First, to cope with dynamic networks and achieve low latency, our approach employs a peer-to-peer (P2P)-based virtual network at the edge and a multi-tiered architecture composed of IoT cameras, edge, and cloud servers. Second, we construct a flexible messaging system for video analysis built upon SINETStream, which is a messaging system that adopts a topic-based pub/sub model. Third, we implement a framework that can remove weather-related (rain, snow, and fog) noise by applying weather classification and adaptive noise removal models that improve the accuracy of video analysis from data collected outdoors. The latency, throughput, and image quality benchmark experiments conducted to validate the feasibility of our proposed system showed that the process resulted in image quality improvements of approximately 30% (on average).","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781127","IoT;Edge Computing;P2P;Video Stream;Object Detection","Image quality;Adaptation models;Image edge detection;Object detection;Streaming media;Throughput;Internet of Things","cameras;cloud computing;computer vision;image sensors;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);message passing;middleware;mobile computing;object detection;peer-to-peer computing;video signal processing;video streaming","weather classification;adaptive noise removal models;image quality benchmark experiments;intelligent live video streaming;object detection;sensors;machine learning models;computer vision;artificial intelligence;low-latency video streaming;distributed mobile IoT devices;dynamic network environments;AI-based data analyses;virtual network;IoT cameras;flexible messaging system;Internet of Things combinations;video data quality degradation;peer-to-peer-based virtual network;multitiered architecture;SINETStream;topic-based pub-sub model;weather-related noise","","","","18","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, the study area (Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture) covered by 73.95% forests, of which approximately 18000 km2. Based on the GEE (Google Earth Engine) cloud computing platform, combined multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery with topography information, three machine learning classifiers, including Regression Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, were used to obtain nine tree species 10m meters of mapping products. An overall accuracy of 81.4% (a Cohen's kappa of 78.5%) was obtained for nine tree species classes. The addition of multi-temporal images improved the OA (over all accuracy) by 8.01%∼12.40%, and Kappa by 8.91%∼12.96%. After combining the terrain features, OA is improved by 9.39%∼14.72%, and Kappa by 10.95%∼18.19%. Obtaining high-quality cloud-free images is difficult for the cloudy and rainy southwest of China, so the composites of multi-temporal images and the combination of other morphoclimatic characteristics are of great significance for large-scale tree species classification.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00258","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:31860182,31860181,41961053,3216140376); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781145","Tree species;Multi-temporal;Google Earth Engine;Machine Learning","Earth;Radio frequency;Cloud computing;Smart cities;Forestry;Surfaces;Thermal pollution","atmospheric temperature;cloud computing;decision trees;ecology;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;remote sensing;terrain mapping;vegetation;vegetation mapping","dominant tree species;mountainous area;multitemporal sentinel-2 data;trees;urban ecological environment;carbon dioxide;urban heat islands;multispectral imagery;single image scene;Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture;Google Earth Engine;combined multitemporal Sentinel-2 imagery;classifiers;Regression Tree;Random Forest;Gradient Boosting Decision Tree;tree species classes;multitemporal images;Kappa;high-quality cloud-free images;large-scale tree species classification","","","","14","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To date, significant work has been devoted to the recognition of mobility modes from the GPS and motion sensor data available on smartphones. However, these approaches often require users to install a special mobile application on their smartphone to collect the sensor data, they are power inefficient and privacy intrusive. Also, bus and car modes are similar in terms of motion due to the same roads, traffic regulations and speed, which makes it challenging to accurately distinguish between the two modes.

The model is like a black box, it is difficult for people to know the reason behind the decision. In fact, the interpretability of the model has made some achievements in the fields of biology, computer vision, and natural language processing. Therefore, in this article, for an intrusion detection system based on deep neural networks, we propose an interpretable artificial intelligence framework to enhance the transparency of machine learning decision-making, that is, which important features the model uses to determine attack or non attack. We use the SHAP method to explain, and combine local and global explanations to realize IDS interpretation in all directions. The partial explanation gives us the reason why the model makes a decision on a particular instance, which gives us a certain reference value. The global interpretation gives the important characteristics of the model as a whole, which helps to improve the transparency of IDS.

Even though intelligent home appliances are capable of ameliorating residents’ quality of life and decreasing their household workload, current Smart Homes are still limited to providing support and services to satisfy the needs of the aging society, small families, and busy lifestyles.In addition to their limited capability, current Smart Homes lack robustness and resilience and introduce some unexpected new challenges, including waste of energy and resource, safety and security concerns, compatibility, discontinued service due to technology obsolescence, and financial challenges which are further aggravated by the imbalanced development of different regions and communities.In this paper, we first discuss the new trend in people’s lifestyles, the major needs of the current society, and the special requirements for their future homes. We further elaborate on the significance and contribution of existing Smart Home systems, the challenges of Smart Home applications, the importance of human involvement, and future development.We then propose the concept of the UV Smart Home and its general framework and evaluate, from the UV perspective, the current status of the Smart Home system based on the framework of a closed feedback control loop: data acquisition, communication, decision-making, and action, as well as the available technologies relevant to each element of the systems.After that, we explore the information flow and material cycle associated with UV Smart Home systems and study how Smart Homes would be affected by these two major impacting factors: information flow and material cycle. The need for information flow and the current absence of centralized management and disorganized information-sharing practices are discussed. We also propose the concept of hierarchical information fusion, addressing the lack of fusion between data content, temporal and spatial information, data from different sources, and the lack of fusion between different informational layers, such as human know-how and system data. The paper also points out that the material cycle is a key element in Smart Homes as it connects all UV components through the exchange of physical products, energy, and natural resources. We investigate and highlight several issues within the current Smart Home material cycle, ranging from improper handling of hazardous materials and exposed electrical wires to unauthorized access to firearms and improper mixing of cleaning substances. This part also emphasizes the risk of cascading failures in interconnected systems and processes. It underscores the need for improved information management, fusion, and coordination, as well as proper handling of materials and resources to ensure the safety and functionality of the UV Smart Home system.In addition, we propose that an effective Smart Home should take into consideration the interaction between Smart Home subsystems and the other seven smart city subsystems: smart medicine and healthcare, intelligent transportation, urban planning and crowd management, smart energy management, smart city infrastructure, smart environmental protection, smart response system for city emergency, and smart humanity. We identify the categories of information exchanges required for the interactions between UV Smart Home systems and other smart subsystems and how such information would support each other and enhance the performance of other smart subsystems.Moreover, we will be examining how human lifestyle and community dynamics could potentially shape the UV Smart Home concept, with a particular focus on their potential to enhance unique and diverse lifestyles, such as those of vulnerable groups. We will delve into how these smart homes can provide tailored support, catering to specific needs, and creating a more inclusive and supportive living environment. Whether it’s aiding the elderly with health monitoring or assisting people with disabilities through enhanced accessibility features, we’ll explore how smart homes can be a beneficial tool for a wide spectrum of lifestyles. In addition to individual lifestyles, we’ll explore how UV Smart Homes can integrate with and benefit diverse communities. We’ll delve into how these smart homes can provide specialized functions to cater to unique community needs, such as communal healthcare monitoring for elderly communities, or enhanced security features for urban neighborhoods. Furthermore, we’ll discuss how the collective strength of a community can compensate for certain limitations of smart homes, like addressing the digital divide or reinforcing community-wide data security, ultimately working towards a better, more sustainable living experience for all.Lastly, based on the in-depth exploration of the complicated dynamic relationship between multiple impacting factors, we propose a UV-oriented, integrated, resilient, inclusive, and sustainable UV Smart Home framework design to address current imminent challenges and to improve residents’ quality of life through multi-source real-time smart monitoring, hierarchical and context-based data fusion, directed information disclosure within families and communities, “home operating system” featuring life-long learning of users’ dynamic preferences, and smart appliances integration for subject-oriented, event-triggered and coordinated home services and actions.The proposed UV Smart Home system offers a comprehensive solution to the challenges identified in this paper. It addresses the diversity of human needs and lifestyles by structuring an integrated, personalized, and dynamic information package that captures various aspects of residents’ lives. The system incorporates a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) package of coordinated processes, consisting of seven core functions and six system objectives, to provide personalized services and functionalities for different living groups and communities. By adopting a closed feedback loop, dynamic adaptiveness, and interactive human involvement, the UV Smart Home system aims to be a highly automated, intelligent, and human-controllable system. It leverages machine learning techniques and user feedback to continually update its knowledge base and adapt to changing lifestyles. The system’s coordination and automation capabilities ensure efficient information flow and seamless coordination across sensing, communication, decision-making, and action stages.","","978-1-6654-7477-1","10.1109/UV56588.2022.10185519","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10185519","smart home;vulnerable group support;homeless support;chronic disease management;senior care;independent living;smart energy management;smart infrastructure support;smart response system for urgent situations;smart mobility;smart humanity;information flow;material cycle;smart lifestyle management;smart community user acceptance;Universal Village;smart monitoring;smart activity understanding;human-computer interaction;computer vision;machine learning;safety and security;adversarial attach;reinforcement learning;adaptive control;system theory;dynamic relationship;coordination & automation;closed feedback loop;robustness & resilience;sustainability","Home appliances;Smart cities;Decision making;Smart homes;Medical services;Safety;Older adults","data acquisition;decision making;Digital Divide;feedback;hazardous materials;health care;home automation;information management;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;smart cities;town and country planning","current Smart Home material cycle;current Smart Homes lack robustness;effective Smart Home;inclusive, UV Smart Home framework design;information flow;resilient UV Smart Home framework design;Smart Home applications;Smart Home subsystems;smart response system;smart subsystems;sustainable UV Smart Home framework design;UV Smart Home concept;UV Smart Home system","","","","471","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, many AAL models are restricted to multiple factors that include computational cost and system complexity. Moreover, the HAR concept has more relevance because of its applications, such as content-based video search, sports play analysis, crowd behavior prediction systems, patient monitoring systems, and surveillance systems. This study implements the HAR system using a popular deep learning algorithm, namely Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the activity data collected from intelligent activity sensors over time. The activity data is available in the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository (UCI). The proposed model involves three processes: (1) data collection, (b) optimal feature learning, and (c) activity recognition. The data gathered from the benchmark repository was initially subjected to optimal feature selection that helped to select the most significant features. The proposed optimal feature selection method is based on a new meta-heuristic algorithm called Colliding Bodies Optimization (CBO). An objective function derived from the recognition accuracy has been used for accomplishing the optimal feature selection. The proposed model on the concerned benchmark dataset outperformed the conventional models with enhanced performance.","","978-1-6654-9457-1","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys53884.2021.00187","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9781060","Human Activity Recognition;Smart Activity Sensors;Optimal Feature Selection;Colliding Bodies Optimization;Recurrent Neural Network","Deep learning;Recurrent neural networks;Ambient assisted living;Surveillance;Activity recognition;Benchmark testing;Feature extraction","assisted living;feature extraction;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;patient monitoring;pattern classification;recurrent neural nets;sport;ubiquitous computing","Human Activity Recognition;Colliding Bodies Optimization -based optimal feature selection;CBO;RNN;intelligent healthcare system;pervasive computing;activity sensor readings;living quality;AAL models;computational cost;system complexity;HAR concept;content-based video search;crowd behavior prediction systems;patient monitoring systems;surveillance systems;HAR system;popular deep learning algorithm;activity data;intelligent activity sensors;UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository;optimal feature learning;optimal feature selection method;recognition accuracy","","","","26","IEEE","30 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To predict locations of base stations (BS) with Cell-ID trajectories and enhance the application of machine learning on Cell-ID trajectory mining, it is essential to learn representations of BSs. Existing methods primarily concentrate on the spatial correlations, which only reflect topological structural relations of BSs, and limit the capability for modeling the BS's representation. To address this issue, we attempt to leverage an unsupervised deep graph embedding technique to learn the representation for large-scale BSs, namely BS2Vec. It incorporates spatial attributes and correlations by developing a variational graph auto encoder with the attention mechanism. The spatial attributes such as vague addresses and Location Area Codes (LAC) imply the coarse-grain location information of BSs, which can significantly enhance the model's ability. To validate BS2Vec, we design a location evaluation task to predict Cell-ID locations merely with Cell-ID trajectories. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the performance gain compared to shallow graph embedding methods. Moreover, it improves the trajectory prediction accuracy from 0.76 to 0.83 compared to the state-of-the-art Cell-ID embedding method.11These authors contributed to the work equally and should be regarded as co-first authors.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074834","representation learning;base station;Cell-ID embedding;graph neural networks","Representation learning;Base stations;Correlation;Codes;Neural networks;Performance gain;Mobile communication","data mining;deep learning (artificial intelligence);graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);unsupervised learning","base station;BS's representation;BS2Vec;Cell-ID locations;Cell-ID trajectories;Cell-ID trajectory mining;large-scale BSs;location evaluation task;machine learning;scale base stations;shallow graph embedding methods;spatial attributes;spatial correlations;spatial representation;state-of-the-art Cell-ID embedding method;trajectory prediction accuracy;unsupervised deep graph;vague addresses;variational graph auto encoder","","","","22","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years various works proposed innovative solutions to help administrations in monitoring various aspects of the city life and the connected services (e.g, the air and noise pollution monitoring to enhance public transportation), but these solutions usually base their proposals only on one of the two most spread approaches: the monitoring based on the data collected through IoT sensors, and the one based only on the suggestions received by users about dangerous or strange situations in the area of the city in which they live. For this reason, this paper proposes an innovative architecture to combine the two approaches. A modular architecture is proposed to support a) the collection of citizens' feedback (positive or negative) in terms of free-text messages, b) the automatic categorization (positive / negative) of received free-text comments performed through both a consolidated topic-detection algorithm and a Machine Learning algorithm based on the sentiment analysis approach, c) the integration of mobile devices and fixed devices for monitoring different areas of the city with respect to the services reviewed by the citizens, d) the visualization of the status of the city and its areas in a dedicated dashboard capable of correlating the two types of data and providing statistics on the real conditions of the areas.

In our framework, soft thresholding is introduced to reduce the noise of the original I/Q signal which contains a lot of noise, so as to reduce the influence of noise on the inaccuracy of RF fingerprint feature extraction. The I/Q signal of the receiver is sliced and spliced (pre-processing step) before inputting to the DRSN model to reduce the computational complexity.

So, the importance of online physical training and evaluation is highly increasing. In this work, we build an online 8-form Tai Chi Chuan (TCC) training and evaluation system, which provides a platform for coaches and users to conduct TCC training and evaluation online. Coaches formulate an evaluation rule and upload coaching videos to the platform, then users watch videos online and submit their own recordings, finally, users will get a score of their recordings. To complete this task, we propose a video capture method to record users' sports exercise videos from different perspectives, construct a 3D pose estimation model to identify human pose from captured video, and propose an evaluation model which can judge users' performance and assign a score to each video. To test our proposed models, we make a dataset consisting of key pose frames of TCC, and the key pose frames are extracted from users' TCC exercise videos.

Specifically, multiple handcrafted features such as shape, texture, and color are fused before the input layer of the neural network, enabling the model to not rely on large amounts of data. The global histogram statistics applied to the binary edge direction graph can reduce the time consumption generated by the overlapping windows in the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG). Experimental results show the superiority of our new feature descriptor compared with HOG, and the 1D ResNet_mix significantly outperforms several excellent machine learning methods, especially in terms of model convergence speed, complexity, and number of parameters than the standard ResNet. It achieves an average test accuracy of 99.58% with a detection speed of 96.89 fps.

Knowledge distillation (KD) is the mainstream approach for models compression, but the existing KD framework has some limitations. First, the student model underperforms when there is a considerable capacity gap between the student and teacher models, which reduces the model compression rate in knowledge distillation. Second, compared with training from scratch, the billions of additional forward propagation of the complex teacher model is time-consuming, resulting longer train time in the distillation process. This paper proposes AKD, an efficient difference-adaptive knowledge distillation framework. AKD consists of two modules. The distillation module uses a modified auxiliary teaching architecture as the backbone, and the adaptive module introduces a difference-adaptive method, which can adjust the teacher model adaptively according to the continuously improving representation ability of the student model. Experimental results on different kinds of datasets and models indicate that AKD not only improves the efficiency of distillation, but also enhances the performance of the compact student model and raise the compression rate.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00297","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074781","model compression;embedded devices;knowledge distillation","Training;Performance evaluation;Deep learning;Adaptation models;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Neural networks","convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);embedded systems","adaptive module;AKD;compact student model;deep neural network models;difference-adaptive knowledge distillation framework;distillation module;distillation process;KD framework;machine learning tasks;model compression rate;resource-constrained embedded devices;resource-limited embedded devices;student model;teacher models","","","","32","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To balance the speed, accuracy, and MAC for embedded systems, we propose a directly connected model (DCM), which relies on existing networks, for fast inference in embedded systems. DCM balances the speed, precision, and MAC with structural reparameterization that decouples its training and inference networks. To further reduce the MAC and latency of DCM for embedded systems, we construct a network optimization frame-work based on recent template-based optimization methods. In the framework, we respectively adopt the machine learning LightGBM and contextual simulated annealing algorithm as the cost model and optimizer to complete rapid optimization in embedded systems. Our comprehensive experiments confirm that our methods achieve a better trade-off among precision, latency, and MAC.

Compared with the other two ensemble strategies such as boosting and bagging, stacking is often better than iterative boosting in training speed because it is an ensemble strategy that parallels base classifiers. Bagging uses a weighted average at the decision level, whereas stacking uses a machine learning model to make decisions, which achieves higher accuracy than bagging using a weighted average decision. The effect of stacking relies heavily on the variance of the base classifiers, and it is often better to ensure that the base classifiers have good learning performance while making the variance among base classifiers as large as possible. The key to imbalanced classification is to deal with the class imbalance and overlapping in training sets. In this study, we will use a hierarchical approach to solve these two problems. Thus, we propose a resampling-based stacking ensemble method combined with clustering. The proposed method uses a support vector machine as the base classifier to solve the problem of losing important information and easily introducing noise in the resampling process through clustering. It also increases the differences among base classifiers. We use the proposed stacking ensemble method to hierarchically solve the class overlapping and then use the cost-sensitive algorithm to solve the class imbalance. The statistical significance analysis of the experimental results shows that the proposed method performs better than existing imbalanced ensemble methods.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00124","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074860","imbalance classification;ensemble learning;stacking;clustering","Training;Support vector machines;Heuristic algorithms;Stacking;Boosting;Complexity theory;Ensemble learning","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;sampling methods;support vector machines","bagging uses;base classifier;class imbalance;clustering resampling stacked ensemble method;ensemble learning;ensemble strategy;imbalance classification problem;imbalance classification task;machine learning model;parallels base classifiers;resampling process;resampling-based;stacking ensemble method;stacking uses;weighted average decision","","","","38","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Researchers have used vocabulary-based methods and machine learning methods to conduct research on sentiment analysis tasks. In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in the field of sentiment analysis. However, for complex textual data, using a single model is often insufficient. Inspired by deep learning models, in this study, we proposed a hybrid model using BiLSTM and attention mechanism, called BiLSTM-ATT model, to solve the problem of sentiment analysis. First, we adopted the GloVe method to train the initialized word embeddings. GloVe converts textual information into word vectors, which can calculate the distance between words. Next, we used a convolutional neural network that can extract local features, and a BiLSTM that can extract long-range semantic features of text with bidirectional extraction of long-term dependencies.

Firstly, we describe short-time traffic speed prediction as a purely spatio-temporal regression prediction problem based on effective features in multiple dimensions. Secondly, we use three separate temporal feature extractors collect the sequence linkages of weekly, daily, and nearest-neighbor periods to solve the prediction task with multiple time steps. Based on this modelling idea, we propose an Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (HSTGCN) model, which can accurately predict the future traffic speed of individual city roads for a given departure time.

Designing smart and sustainable cities is a challenge whose solutions are not easy. Also, developing a proposed smart city is a time-consuming process as it involves its foundations, analyzing the needs, latest technology, infrastructure, and topography. This paper aims to analyze the patterns followed by cities worldwide in the quest to make smart cities. This shall also show how newer cities can become innovative based on the work already done by the existing cities through the concept of Inheritance. In order to do this, a dataset comprising 102 cities is analyzed based on six metrics. A combination of the Principal Component Analysis and K-means Clustering technique is used to assist with the analysis of this unlabeled dataset. It is thereby shown that these 102 cities can be identified as belonging to 4 clusters and the cluster properties can then be inherited by any new city poised to become a future smart city.","","978-1-6654-3215-3","10.1109/PARC52418.2022.9726254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9726254","Smart cities;Sustainable cities;Machine Learning;Unsupervised Learning;Principal Component Analysis;K-means Clustering","Measurement;Earth;Renewable energy sources;Smart cities;Decision making;Surfaces;Internet of Things","pattern clustering;principal component analysis;smart cities;unsupervised learning","city planners;sustainable cities;smart city;unsupervised learning;unlabeled dataset;principal component analysis;k-means clustering","","","","27","IEEE","9 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, it is critical to design techniques that can reduce the overhead of retraining reinforcement learning models, enabling them adapt to constantly changing environments. In this paper, toward improving the performance of learning models in dynamic Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), we propose an online continuous reinforcement learning strategy. In our process, when the retraining condition is triggered, our online continuous learning strategy will re-engage the training process and update the well-trained model. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we categorize the entire application space for applying reinforcement learning to IIoT systems into four scenarios, namely, non-continuous learning without learning model sharing, non-continuous learning with learning model sharing, continuous learning without learning model sharing, and continuous learning without learning model sharing. For each scenario, we design a Q-learning based reinforcement learning algorithm. Via extensive evaluation, our results show that the online continuous reinforcement learning approach that we propose can significantly reduce the overhead of retraining the learning model, enabling the learning algorithm to quickly adapt to a changing environment.","","978-1-6654-1236-0","10.1109/SWC50871.2021.00046","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604405","Industrial Internet of Things;Online continuous learning;Reinforcement learning","Training;Adaptation models;Technological innovation;Smart cities;Reinforcement learning;Internet;Industrial Internet of Things","industrial engineering;Internet of Things;production engineering computing;reinforcement learning","training machine learning models;application environment changes;noncontinuous learning;model sharing;Q-learning based reinforcement learning algorithm;online continuous reinforcement learning approach;industrial Internet of Things;IIoT;retraining condition;training process","","1","","22","IEEE","18 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Perseverance and self-motivation are mandatory to make sedentary office hours effective. However, these qualities are not common to everyone. It causes an imbalance in workload distribution and scheduling which facilitates the possibility of irrelevant performance evaluation. This paper addresses these issues and proposes a novel algorithm to optimally schedule the workforce in a sedentary office environment.

Several smart applications are developed by using different artificial intelligence models to enhance the education. A chatbot is considered as one of these advanced technologies that can be deployed in schools to enhance the education and learning processes in smart cities. However, high schools are the most crucial stage in student’s life as they have higher stress levels regarding their future compared to other students. They need advices more than others do, for example, they need help to find the best-fit universities and courses that can fit with their interests and goals, however, most previous studies focused on providing chatbots for supporting the matriculated and new incoming students at universities. Therefore, to fill this gap, this study aims to develop a novel chatbot for supporting students in high schools particularly by using the Multinomial Naive-Bayes and Random Forest algorithms, which can be, able to understand the natural language of students’ enquiries and accordingly, the intention class for each question will be predicted. The data in this study is comprised of 505 questions, which were obtained from multiple resources such as students' blogs, schools' counsellors, students, parents as well as from schools & universities' websites. The results in this study shows that the performance of the chatbot is improved by using the techniques of pre-processing and the feature extractions such as CountVectorizers and TF-IDF. Moreover, the results show that the Random Forest classifier performed better than Multinomial Naive-Bayes in all metrics. The performance of the models is checked by using different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score and all show high scores with exceeding 90%. However, the accuracy of Multinomial Naive-Bayes classifier achieved higher score when using CountVectorizers compared to using the TF-IDF. In the future work, this result will be investigated by re-evaluated the model with using a large corpus with students’ enquiries.","","978-953-290-128-3","10.23919/SpliTech58164.2023.10193065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10193065","smart city;sustainability;intent classification;features extraction;multinomial naive-bayes;random forest;chatbot;machine learning;high school","Measurement;Smart cities;Natural languages;Forestry;Educational technology;Chatbots;Prediction algorithms","","","","","","30","","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One critical task in the last mile delivery process is the computation of a set of optimal delivery tours for a set of given delivery locations. This task is commonly known as the vehicle routing problem. In this work, we propose an extended version of the vehicle routing problem that aims to increase the degree of automation in the last mile delivery process by leveraging on the current advancements in the area of autonomous driving. Furthermore, we study the application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods to solve the proposed problem. We show that such a set up can reduce the overall time needed for delivering parcels compared to the conventional method, in which the delivery agent manually drives the delivery vehicle to each delivery address. In addition, the proposed model is computationally cheap which is essential to support close to real time analysis of context changes (e.g., traffic situation) and decision making, which is critical for an application in the context of highly dynamic Smart City environments.","","978-1-6654-0424-2","10.1109/PerComWorkshops51409.2021.9430987","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9430987","last-mile delivery;parcel logistics;vehicle routing","Pervasive computing;Automation;Smart cities;Conferences;Vehicle routing;Routing;Real-time systems","electric vehicles;goods distribution;learning (artificial intelligence);logistics;optimisation;postal services;smart cities;vehicle routing","rendezvous delivery;autonomous electric vehicles;last mile parcel delivery;urban areas;parcel logistics process;mile delivery process;optimal delivery tours;delivery location;vehicle routing problem;delivery agent;delivery vehicle;smart city environment;machine learning methods","","","","22","IEEE","24 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A commonly used strategy is gathering videos from cameras and processing them in the cloud or edge server. However, limited bandwidth between cameras and the server results in the inefficiency of existing central-based video analytics systems. In this paper, we effectively reduce the bandwidth demands by proposing a novel object filtering method while keeping the resolution of the video. Specifically, we adopt the moving object detection algorithm on the camera side to find regions in the video and encode these regions into high-resolution video.

However, it is important to note that UAVs can also be maliciously utilized as a threat to public safety and pose a significant risk to the stability and execution of smart city applications. Detection of flying intruders can be performed using various sensors such as cameras, RADAR, and LIDAR. In this paper, we propose an automated framework for UAV detection and classification using ground cameras. First, we use YOLOv8 for detecting UAVs, and then we use an unsupervised clustering approach to classify the detected objects according to their different categories. The clustering process is performed by extracting the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features of the detected UAVs. Afterward, the features are embedded by mapping them into a two-dimensional space where the separation of the classes is possible.

Deep learning based approaches can learn features from raw traffic automatically, but they need labeled data, and the size of the dataset has a direct effect on the modeling effect. This paper proposes a self-supervised mobile encrypted traffic classification method to address these issues. called METC-MVAE. It learns a relational representation of traffic from large-scale unlabeled data, and can fast learn the downstream task with a small dataset by finetuning. We test our method on both private and public datasets. We collected more than 1,160,000 traffic flows from 300 of the most popular mobile encryption Apps as the private dataset.

However, due to the increasing sophistication of today's network attacks and the growing cost of obtaining attack labels for network traffic, updating an IDS model with labeled data requires significant effort. Furthermore, in real-time developments of the Internet of Things (IoT), network flow input and large-size deep learning models impose additional latency and low throughput due to the hardware resource, bandwidth, and programming cost. To this end, this paper proposes an on-device sequential learning semi-supervised anomaly detector-based intrusion detection system (ONLAD-IDS) using smart interface network cards (NICs) to address these challenges. The ONLAD- IDS consists of packet sniffing, feature extractor, feature selection with analysis of variance (ANOVA), and an ONLAD model. Moreover, the real-time throughput ONLAD-IDS is developed by the Nvidia Bluefield DPU with smartNICs without programming cost. Experiments show that ONLAD-IDS achieves a throughput of 1486.095 packet/ms and a detection rate of 0.7523 on DPU with a 25Gb/s transmission throughput while maintaining high detection performance.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074646","Intrusion detection system;on-device learning;semi-supervised learning;smartNIC;Bluefield DPU","Training;Costs;Intrusion detection;Telecommunication traffic;Programming;Throughput;Feature extraction","computer network security;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;security of data;telecommunication traffic","anomaly detector-based intrusion detection system;current threat detection;detection rate;high detection performance;IDS model;large-size deep learning models;network attacks;network flow input;network traffic;neural network-based intrusion detection systems;ONLAD model;ONLAD- IDS;ONLAD-based intrusion detection system;ONLAD-IDS;programming cost;smart interface network cards","","","","36","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While a wide range of VSR models is available with different processing capabilities and overhead, there is no consensus on the best model to use. This is because the optimal choice changes depending on the input video and the quality requirement. We present AssyVSR, an adaptive framework to dynamically choose the right VSR model to use from a model pool based on the input video and quality requirement. AssyVSR achieves this by using machine learning to build a model selector based on classification. Our classifier takes as input a set of numerical feature values of the input video and then predicts the best model to use for a given video resolution. The model is trained offline from training data, and the trained model can be applied to any unseen videos. AssyVSR further employs transfer learning to quickly update its model selector when the pool of candidate models changes without incurring significant training overhead. We evaluate AssyVSR by applying it to a representative mobile computation offloading environment using real hardware and over 3000 videos. Experimental results show that AssyVSR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model selection scheme and the SOTA super-resolution model by producing higher-quality videos and reducing the response time by over 60% when compared with the SOTA super-resolution model.","","979-8-3503-1993-4","10.1109/HPCC-DSS-SmartCity-DependSys57074.2022.00172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074697","video super-resolution;model selection;transfer learning;performance optimisation","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Superresolution;Transfer learning;Neural networks;Predictive models;Data models","computer vision;deep learning (artificial intelligence);image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;pattern classification;video signal processing","adaptive framework;adaptive model selection;AssyVSR;building VSR;candidate models changes;computer vision tasks;deep neural networks;different processing capabilities;given video resolution;higher-quality videos;input video;model pool;model selector;optimal choice changes;quality requirement;significant training overhead;SOTA super-resolution model;state-of-the-art model selection scheme;trained model;unseen videos;video super resolution;video super-resolution techniques;VSR model","","","","41","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine Learning (ML) approaches are applied to the dataset for predictive modelling of the variables. The analysis includes: (i) one-model for all player positions and (ii) position-based models for respective player position. The evaluated models from both regression and classification verify that better accuracies can be obtained in the position-based models rather than the one-model for all positions approach. In addition, a smaller set of features with higher information content are obtained using principal component analysis (PCA).

This typically involves processing huge volumes of data in central servers and sending updated models to end-user devices. There are two main concerns on this server architecture, one is the privacy of data that is being transferred to a central server and the other is volumes of data sent over the network for the model update. Federated Learning helps solve these problems by training models on local data within the device and aggregating the model with other devices. Federated Learning involves a central server for the aggregation and the resulting updates to the clients, here only model parameters are shared with the central server not the data itself thereby preserving privacy. But all the applications are not being compatible with Federated Learning and also there is a privacy concern of models being shared to the central server which can be susceptible to malicious attacks. In this paper, central server free Federated Learning, which is decentralized Federated Learning is used, where the parameters will be exchanged between the clients one to one and get their models updated removing the need for a central server for aggregation. Peer-to-peer techniques are used for communicating between clients and different node architectures to achieve better accuracy. This happens when the clients meet another client in a connected social network environment. The results show that the communication happens between clients in a decentralized fashion and thereby achieving privacy in a more trusted manner.","","978-1-6654-1236-0","10.1109/SWC50871.2021.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604380","","Training;Privacy;Data privacy;Technological innovation;Social networking (online);Smart cities;Collaborative work","data privacy;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);peer-to-peer computing;social networking (online)","machine learning techniques;central servers;sending updated models;end-user devices;server architecture;model update;training models;model parameters;central server free federated learning;malicious attacks;privacy concern","","2","","23","IEEE","18 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A large amount of research has been done on detecting these attacks in real time, however mitigation is left to security experts, which is time consuming and may have economic consequences. In addition, there is no public data available for action selection that could enable the use of the latest techniques in machine learning or deep learning for this area. Currently, most systems deploy a rule-based response selection methodology for mitigating detected attacks. In this paper, we introduce a situation calculus-based approach to automated response for IoT cyberattacks. The approach offers explicit semantic-rich cognitive modeling of attacks, effects and actions and supports situation inference for timely and accurate responses.

IoT devices collect or produce huge multi-modal data that is either processed on the edge or sent to a central cloud for processing. The collected data sets are pre-processed by methods known as “feature selection”, to remove redundant, irrelevant, or noisy features. Feature selection will help with improving the results achieved by the learning method as well as reducing the computational complexity of the model. The goal is to select the most informative features of data and only transmit the selected features to the edge/cloud servers for further processing. This leads to smaller costs for data transmission to the servers. In this paper, a novel wrapper-based federated feature selection (FFS) algorithm is proposed, where IoT devices collaborate to select the most informative features without sharing their local data sets. The proposed FFS algorithm uses binary gravitational search algorithm (BGSA) in a federated and collaborative manner to select a small enough subset of informative attributes and provide an improved trade-off between communication cost and learning accuracy. Our experimental results on three data sets including MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and MAV demonstrate that the proposed BGSAFFS method can in average remove more than 50% of features without losing information. The obtained results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving a good trade-off between accuracy and communication cost in comparison to other state-of-the-art feature selection methods as well as a no-feature selection baseline.","","978-1-6654-5719-4","10.1109/ICNC57223.2023.10074296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10074296","Feature selection;Federated Learning;Internet-of-Things;Machine Learning","Learning systems;Costs;Smart cities;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Servers","cloud computing;computational complexity;computer network security;feature extraction;feature selection;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems;smart cities","binary gravitational search algorithm;central cloud;collaborative manner;collected data sets;data transmission;feature selection algorithm;federated manner;FFS algorithm;huge multimodal data;improved trade-off between communication cost;informative features;IoT devices;IoT environments;learning accuracy;learning method;local data sets;no-feature selection baseline;noisy features;novel wrapper-based;smart city initiative;state-of-the-art feature selection methods;Things applications;wrapper-based federated feature selection","","","","12","IEEE","23 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fortunately, the field of electronics and informatics has seen a significant advancement in recent times, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications. One such application is the use of AI in crime forecasting and analysis, which has the potential to facilitate smart living and smart city initiatives, as well as economic development. This paper presents a study on the use of regression techniques and predictive models, Linear regression, LASSO regression and ridge regression for crime prediction and magnitude estimation, with an average predictive accuracy of 94.0%. The most important features contributing to crime prediction were identified and analyzed using heatmaps thus providing insights for proactive action by crime prevention authorities. Additionally, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) were provided to enhance the interpretability and accountability of the developed models.

In this research, related open cases in a developing country are discussed, focusing on the exploration of emerging opportunities and challenges for the next generation of ML in the field of smart city, smart industry, and smart health service with case-studies from Indonesia. Federated Learning (FL) is a new paradigm of ML with a multi-client scheme.

Several large industries and companies in Indonesia were observed in this research to find out which sectors could most realize and increase the effectiveness and excellence of FL in advancing ML. Then possible solutions to deal with these challenges are proposed, one of which is the internet of things for smart cities and industries based on the federation mechanism which has great sector potential in Indonesia. Some areas of government and industry where FL can be integrated seamlessly are also listed.

While the transit system is responsible for maintaining and delivering public transportation services for the city residents, they rely on idealized assumptions regarding real-world bus driving conditions. The published bus schedule seems to assume that the buses move at a uniform speed at all times, which leads to bus arrival times that are imprecise and inaccurate. Busses can arrive early, late, or on time. Given that bus stops cannot have a dynamic schedule, it is logical to create a schedule accounting for the changes in traffic patterns. Hence, in this paper, we present a transportation analytics solution. It captures imprecision via fuzzy logic. It takes in account lane closures (for construction sites) and traffic count when predicting bus on-time performance via regression. Evaluation on real-life data covering close to 6,000 bus stops in the Canadian city of Winnipeg demonstrates the practicality of our fuzzy logic- and regression-based transportation analytics solution in predicting whether buses arrive the bus stops early, on time, or late in various time periods of the day.

The safety of the power grid depends on the ability to identify and stop electricity theft. The use of deep learning techniques has shown great promise in recent years, particularly in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing. This study recommends a random forest-based ensemble deep learning method for identifying cases of electricity theft. The proposed ensemble deep learning model leverages the best features of many kinds of deep learning architectures, including stacked Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Each architecture has its own strengths when it comes to monitoring normal and abnormal electrical use for signs of theft. The final forecast is derived by adding together the predictions of the different models in the random forest ensemble. The ensemble model is trained using a massive dataset of energy usage records and theft information. Information about consumption patterns is extracted using feature engineering methods once the dataset has been preprocessed to get rid of noise and outliers. This preprocessed dataset is used to train the ensemble model, which then optimizes its parameters to reduce prediction errors. We use many measures, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the proposed ensemble deep learning model’s performance. Experiments are run against both conventional machine learning methods and standalone deep learning models to prove that the ensemble method is superior. The findings demonstrate that the ensemble model is more accurate and has a greater detection rate, making it suitable for spotting energy theft.","","979-8-3503-9663-8","10.1109/ICCES57224.2023.10192747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10192747","Internet of Things;Edge Computing;Smart City;Offloading;Multi-Feedback","Deep learning;Computational modeling;Simulation;Forestry;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Smart grids","","","","","","18","IEEE","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the communication network is not secure against an impersonation attack as the LoRa end devices are equipped with the keys. If a device gets compromised, the attacker may have access to the keys. In this paper, we enhance the security of OTAA by introducing multifactor authentication of the device using the unique fingerprint of the end device. We extract the unique features and generate the device fingerprint using supervised machine learning methods namely the decision tree, random forest, naive Bayes, and k-nearest neighbor. To verify the proposed scheme we have used an existing dataset of the LoRa devices. Our proposed scheme ensures secure key sharing among the end devices and protects them from impersonation attacks.

In such situations, it is necessary to quickly identify the problem and take appropriate action, such as calling for help. This can be supported or even automated by using vision-based AI systems. In this context, we investigated and evaluated different AI solutions for rapid human action recognition. More specifically, we trained and compared artificial neural networks (ANN) in combination with frame-based cameras to a processing pipeline using spiking neural networks (SNN) and event-based cameras. For the SNNs, we further distinguished and compared two models, which we simulated in software and implemented on event-based hardware. The SNNs feature various layer types, e.g. fully-connected, spiking convolutions and recurrent. The implementation on event-based hardware was compared to GPU-based embedded hardware for artificial neural networks. The comparison was made primarily with regard to the highest possible energy efficiency in order to enable battery-powered vision systems in the future that can be used flexibly not only in assisted living, but also in industrial and smart city applications. The networks were constructed in such a way that they achieve a similar classification accuracy, which was measured on our own dataset specifically recorded for the project.","","978-1-6654-8849-5","10.1109/SSI56489.2022.9901412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9901412","spiking neural network;neuromorphic computing;artificial neural network;machine learning;event-based camera","Smart cities;Machine vision;Pipelines;Artificial neural networks;System integration;Cameras;Hardware","assisted living;cameras;computer vision;image motion analysis;image sensors;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","SNNs;event-based hardware;GPU-based embedded hardware;artificial neural networks;battery-powered vision systems;spiking neural networks;ambient-assisted living;vision-based AI systems;rapid human action recognition;frame-based cameras;event-based cameras","","","","28","IEEE","3 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In smart cities, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) will play a vital role for providing services in the urban environment. These services include real time monitoring and reaction in time through wireless sensor and actuator networks. Smart Grids (SGs), Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Internet of Things (IoT), Electric Vehicles (EVs), and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), supported by the advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), will be the building blocks of futuristic smart cities. In this presentation we will address ML techniques with a focus on intelligent automated electric transportation systems whether on-road vehicles or Un-maned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in smart cities. Current capabilities as well as limitations and opportunities of key AI enabling technologies will be reviewed, along with a discussion on the impact of such advances on society and the environment. All these technologies will help to build a smart city.","2770-6575","979-8-3503-2019-0","10.1109/ICCTA58027.2022.10206313","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10206313","","","","","","","","","IEEE","10 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A complete record of the panel discussion was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Smart cities can be described as a smart system comprising numerous integrated smart systems that fuse and share data, including personal and potentially sensitive private information. Such circumstances could intrude on the rights to privacy, and human dignity, with disclosures potentially harmful to the individual, families, friends, associates, and communities. This workshop will examine ways to promote the best outcomes for the residents and visitors of smart cities through the lens of human rights. Affective rights will also be discussed as requisite to formulating the optimal smart city. Moreover, this workshop will foster discussion around the still relatively nascent technology of Affective Computing, which is the application of AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), biometric measurement, sentiment analysis, and psychological factor assessment in determining and interacting with the affective states of the individual. This workshop is open to all stakeholders in smart city development and management, including computer scientists, engineers, smart city integrators, application developers, third party vendors, ethicists, city managers and administrators. It should be especially informative for oversight and governance organizations providing auditing and performance evaluations.","2158-3412","978-1-6654-3580-2","10.1109/ISTAS52410.2021.9629191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9629191","Smart cities;human rights;ethics;collective bargaining;sustainable development","Smart cities;Ethics;Stakeholders;Media;Lenses;Industrial relations","biometrics (access control);data privacy;ethical aspects;learning (artificial intelligence);smart cities","human rights;smart system;personal information;potentially sensitive private information;human dignity;affective rights;smart city development;AI;smart city management;artificial intelligence;ML;machine learning;biometric measurement;sentiment analysis;psychological factor assessment","","","","","IEEE","6 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
