During the last two decades, a lot of machine learning models have been proposed and applied on different types of real time applications to classify their real time traffic and obtain very proficient accuracy results. However, no research has been done on WeChat text and picture messages traffic classification. In this paper, WeChat text and picture messages traffics are classified using two different types of datasets and 4 well-known machine learning algorithms. These two datasets, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) and Dorm13, are collected from two different network environments. Having captured the traffic 50 features, they are extracted respectively. Thereafter, well-known four machine learning algorithms C4.5 decision tree, Bayes Net, Naïve Bayes and SVM are used to classify WeChat text and picture messages traffic. Experimental result analysis show that using HIT data set all the applied machine learning classifiers classify WeChat text and picture messages traffic very accurately as compared to Dorm13 dataset. Using HIT dataset, all ML classifier perform very well, but C4.5 and SVM are the ones that give very effective accuracy results of 99.91% and 99.57% respectively as compared to other ML classifiers.","","978-1-5090-4297-5","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828360","Traffic Classification;WeChat;Message;Text and Picture;Machine Learning","Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Training;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Decision trees;Message service","Bayes methods;belief networks;decision trees;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;quality of service;support vector machines;telecommunication traffic;text analysis","SVM;naïve Bayes;Bayes net;decision tree;Dorm13;HIT;Harbin Institute of Technology;QoSs;quality of services;ISPs;Internet service providers;machine learning;picture messages service flow traffic classification;Wechat text","","9","","23","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three of those methods, namely a linear regression (LM), a long short-term memory network (LSTM) and a neural network model (NN), have been selected to see their performance on predicting the load of a large smart city on the example of the Estonian electricity consumption data. Hourly data of the year 2019 was used as training data to predict the first 20 days of 2020. For this kind of prediction, the LM showed the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and had the lowest computational time. The neural network was slightly less accurate. The LSTM showed the worst performance in terms of accuracy and computational time. Thus, LSTM is not the preferred method for this kind of prediction and the recommendation for forecasting such loads would be a LM because the RMSE and computational effort needed are lower than for a NN.","2166-9546","978-1-7281-4218-0","10.1109/CPE-POWERENG48600.2020.9161690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9161690","Time Series Analysis;Smart City;Machine Learning;Load Forecast;Load Prediction;Distribution Grid","Predictive models;Neural networks;Load modeling;Linear regression;Smart cities;Production;Forecasting","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;power consumption;power engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;renewable energy sources;smart cities;time series","accuracy analysis;machine learning methods;smart city;Estonian electricity consumption forecast;renewable energy sources;time series analysis;long short-term memory network;LSTM;neural network model;Estonian electricity consumption data;linear regression;time 20.0 d","","7","","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This leads to not only the raw material problem but also the environmental pollution. We found out that the 2 main reasons cause people do not litter their waste appropriately are 1) they lack of basic knowledge how to separate the valuable waste correctly, and 2) they lack of motivation to separate the valuable waste. From this point of view, we designed a holistic waste management system that tries to tackle these problems using modern Information Technology. The system consists of 2 parts; the first one is the software design and implementation including web-based waste management application and mobile-application-based rewarding system; whereas the second one is the hardware design and implementation based on Internet of Things and Machine Learning technology. This part can recognize and separate 3 kinds of waste automatically, namely glass bottles, plastic bottles, and metal cans. The system is tested and it functions as expected. It can separate the mentioned 3 kinds of waste with good results. The rewarding system on mobile application allows the people to collect the points and get rewarded.

SOA system evolution and maintenance is challenging because of its distributive nature and secondly due to the demand of designing high-quality, stable interfaces. This evolution leads to a problem called Anti-patterns in web services. It is observed that these anti-patterns negatively impact the evolution and maintenance of software systems, making the early detection and correction of them a primary concern for the software developers. The primary motivation of this work is to investigate the relationship between the Web Service Description Language(WSDL) metrics and anti-patterns in web services. This research aims to develop an automatic method for the detection of web service anti-patterns. The core idea of the methodology defined is to identify the most crucial WSDL metrics with the association of various feature selection techniques for the prediction of anti-patterns. Experimental results show that the model developed by using all the WSDL quantity metrics(AM) shows a bit high performance compared to the models developed with the other metric sets.

If a business such as shopping center, restau-rant, coffee shop, hospital, clothing etc. is opened in optimal location; not only the satisfaction level of the customers are enhanced with increased life quality and convenience, but also it maximizes the profit of the entrepreneurs. However, it is complex and long-term decision to find optimal location for a business. Therefore; we propose a smart business application that uses machine learning techniques to estimate the location of a business. The proposed system collects key feature values for a specific business and learns a prediction model for future data. It estimates features and suggests clusters of districts that have optimal locations for that specific business. The proposed system is evaluated on a use case that estimates the best possible locations of a restaurant according to main characteristics taken as inputs from entrepreneurs via a Web based application. These characteristics are Meal Price per customer, HouseHold Type, Gender, and Age. The first phase of decision process is estimating mentioned features such as House Price per district and local population belonging to different HouseHold type, Gender, and Age with less error rates for the consecutive years. Here; we determine an optimal regression model choosing from SMORegression (SMOReg), MultiLayerPerceptron (MLP), and multivariate Linear Regression (Linear) according to Relative Absolute Error (RAE %) parameter, for each feature. The second phase clusters districts according to these estimated features by using hierarchical tree. As a result; the estimated best suggestions for restaurant locations which have similar features, are shown to entrepreneurs via our Web based application. It should be noted that, the application can produce generic solution for the needs of entrepreneurs.","","978-1-5386-6614-2","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622957","Smart Cities;Location Estimation;Relative Absolute Error;Regression;Hierarchical Clustering","Business;Smart cities;Estimation;Machine learning;Error analysis;Optimization","data mining;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;regression analysis;smart cities;town and country planning","complex decision process;entrepreneurs;coffee shop;optimal location;customer;increased life quality;long-term decision;smart business application;key feature values;Web based application;mentioned features;machine learning techniques;business location estimator;smart city application;restaurant locations;estimated best suggestions;estimated features;phase clusters districts;optimal regression model","","11","","17","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Presently there is indeed no good solution to this problem. The existing applications and devices are not much effective as they need lot of human interaction to operate. These existing devices use to read the human temperature and heartbeat to generate alarm in case of emergency. When a person runs, every human may have different body temperature and heartbeat pattern and thus keeping a fixed threshold for finding out emergency situation and then generating alarm is not correct way and this is where the existing devices are failing to correctly generate alarm in case of emergency. In this paper the devices are customized to learn the individual pattern of temperature and heartbeat and then it finds out the threshold for generating alarm. Thus this paper deals to design a wearable women safety device that automatically reads and create patterns such as body temperature and pulse rate during running. If readings are higher than the normal readings then it will automatically call and message more than one person along with the location so that actions can be taken. We have used temperature and pulse sensors that will detect the activity of the woman and that data of sensors will be sent to cloud where machine learning algorithm (logistic regression) is applied to analyse the data generated. The data is first collected by sensors in non-danger conditions to train the algorithm, after that data is used for testing to gauge the accuracy and how close it is to our trained data. More is the accuracy more is the surety of danger and the emergency alarm will be there on emergency contacts. Thirdly, this paper deals with scenarios where there is no internet facility. To overcome the problem of internet we have used ZigBee mesh network, which helped the device to send the data to multiple hop distance.","","978-1-5386-9380-3","10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560188","Women safety device;Body Temperature;Machine Learning;Logistic regression;Danger prediction;Automatic danger detection;Customized device;Pulse sensor;Cloud computing;Data analysis;Emergency Alarm;Zigbee mesh network;Work without internet;Location message","Temperature sensors;GSM;Machine learning algorithms;Cloud computing;Global Positioning System;Temperature measurement","alarm systems;emergency services;Internet;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;safety devices;wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","human interaction;existing devices;human temperature;heartbeat pattern;fixed threshold;emergency situation;generating alarm;individual pattern;wearable women safety device;pulse rate;normal readings;pulse sensors;machine learning algorithm;trained data;emergency alarm;emergency contacts;body temperature","","12","","13","IEEE","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From the smart city perspective, the main goal is to make well-informed decisions, on the base of a variable number of sensors and sources, exposing different data with different protocols and structures. The urban contexts may change, and with them, the number of sensors deployed. The novel smart city service must go beyond an integration strategy, it needs an exploitation model to optimally retrieve useful and highly contextualized information. In this paper we focus on the development of a model which fuses together the IoE potential and machine learning techniques for the cognitive smart city: retrive useful intelligent information, optimally exploiting the infrastructure the specific physical context may offer. We propose an approach and related techniques for realizing context agnostic services, namely services that do not depend on the enabling infrastructure beneath. The purpose is to create an IoE-based self-contextualizing service, which potentially consider the entire range of data that is being collected in smart cities and use such data to provide highly-personalized information about each environment, i.e., information that best suits the context of each Smart City. To prove the proposed context agnostic service, we take into account the air quality observation issue: we provide two high-contextualized informative services to leverage data related to two different physical environments, thus building location awareness for different geographic areas and stakeholders. But still managed by the same application which can adapts itself. Finally we present the evaluation of this prototype to illustrate the benefits of our solution and the future work.","","978-953-290-091-0","10.23919/SpliTech.2019.8783138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8783138","IoT;IoE;Machine Learning;Cognitive Smart City;Air Pollution;Data Harmonization","Smart cities;Intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;Data models;Location awareness","building management systems;geographic information systems;information services;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;smart cities;ubiquitous computing","smart city service;physical environments;geographic areas;IoT era;upcoming IoE paradigm;context agnostic air quality service;stakeholders;leverage data;informative services;air quality observation issue;smart cities;IoE-based self-contextualizing service;context agnostic service;specific physical context;retrive useful intelligent information;cognitive smart city;exploitation model;urban contexts;well-informed decisions;smart city perspective","","","","41","","1 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is very challenging that traffic administrative enforcements face limited manpower to prohibit unlicensed taxis, due to costly and time-consuming procedure of on-site evidence collection. In this paper, we propose an effective service to incorporate human mobility mechanism into unlicensed taxis detection from massive city-wide vehicles. We first extract 276 spatio-temporal features, which are grouped into two categories, including daily behaviors and sustainable behaviors to capture the mobility characteristics of unlicensed taxis. Second, we investigate the detection accuracy of three machine learning techniques, viz. support vector machines, decision tree, and logical regression. We illustrate our approach using real-world vehicle license plate recognition dataset in Xiamen, China, which contains 336 million passing records for 6.2 million vehicles filmed by 439 devices in August 2016. Experimental results reveal that LR outperforms SVM and DT in prediction accuracy and F-score measurement, while SVM is capable of identifying the largest number of unlicensed taxis.","","978-1-5386-0752-7","10.1109/ICWS.2017.106","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8029849","unlicensed taxi;anomaly detection;human mobility;big data analytics","Public transportation;Sensors;Feature extraction;License plate recognition;Urban areas;Trajectory;Support vector machines","automobiles;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);optical character recognition;regression analysis;spatiotemporal phenomena;support vector machines;traffic engineering computing","city traffic regulation;public safety;car-hailing services;unlicensed vehicles;real-world vehicle license plate recognition dataset;unlicensed taxi detection service;large-scale vehicle mobility data;spatio-temporal feature extraction;sustainable behaviors;daily behaviors;machine learning techniques;F-score measurement;prediction accuracy;China;Xiamen;logical regression;decision tree;support vector machines","","8","","10","IEEE","11 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The paper recognizes the mentioned gap manifesting in a new smart urban area in Wales, UK, and presents a platform which intends to demonstrate the benefits of exploiting the synergies between these fields of research. Following consultation with various stakeholders at the pilot site, the platform utilizes advanced sensing, analytics, interoperability, and visualization components to provide valuable human-machine interactions to facility managers in the district.

The paper presents the platform's software architecture, before discussing the decision support interface, intelligent web services, and interoperability components in more detail. The solution's key contributions beyond existing internet of things platforms are the use of a 3D game engine, machine learning and optimization web services, and the integration across the knowledge value chain.

A basic definition of rural-urban linkages is that they consist of flows (of goods, people, information, finance, waste, information, social relations) across space, linking rural and urban areas (Cecilia, 2015). Economically, rural and urban areas are linked by the reciprocal exchange of unprocessed and processed products, with both areas acting as mutually reinforcing markets [1]. Perhaps a less descriptive definition is of the functional links between sectors (agriculture, industry and services). The latter is central to structural change taking place in both rural and urban areas. Additionally, rural and urban economies exhibit symbiotic relationship. Cecilia [2] notes ""in many regions of the world we are witnessing an increase in production, especially of perishable and high-value products such as fruit, vegetables and dairy, responding to urban demand"". This is especially the case in rural areas that are well connected to urban markets by transport links, communications and electricity, and by networks of local traders (Cecilia, 2015). This is especially true with Dairy Industry. The dairy industry exhibits mini ecosystem of rural and urban linkage. The dairy industry plays an important role for both rural and urban dwellers: a) a major source of rural employment (12% to 14% of world population [6]), b) consistent non-seasonal source of income with immediate cash returns, c) major urban consumer staple and d) major contributor of agriculture GDP in developing countries. In many developing countries, dairy industry employees majority of workforce from rural and have direct influence on rural and urban commerce. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [3], ""more than 6 billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products; the majority of these people live in developing countries"" [2]. It's clear from the above, urban and rural areas have symbiotic relationship and in order to make urban areas smart, aka Smart Cities, it is imperative that the linkage of urban, in this case rural areas, needs be Smart entities, aka. Smart Villages. For making Smart Village, according to Viswanadham [7] ""the existing infrastructure and services (such as Power, Water, Buildings, Retail, Health care, etc.) need to be upgraded and in building the new ones. This requires standardization, use of IT and sensor networks"". In this research paper, we propose innovative approach to develop dairy IoT sensor network that enables Smart dairy, making Smart Villages a reality. We offer development of Smart Dairy IoT Sensors that not only identify cattle related health issues but also enable data and information sharing with dairy farmers for better predicting milk production and improvement of productivity. In addition, the data collected from IoT sensor and analytics models play pivotal role in preventing spread of viral flus and cattle health issues. Finally, the data collected from our IoT Dairy sensors and analytics will enable digital transformation at village level thus enabling cities smarter.

Smart city infrastructure incorporating the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm offers substantial advantages in terms of real-time waste monitoring capability. Basic sensory monitoring by itself, however, falls short of achieving optimal waste management without comprehensive data analytics. To this end, the present work proposes an off-the-shelf IoT-based waste monitoring solution, combined with back-end data analytics for efficient waste collection. The work employs Raspberry Pi and ultrasonic sensors, mounted on waste-bins in a specific area of a cooperating municipality for waste capacity monitoring. Realtime bin status and machine learning analytics are used to identify present as well as predict future waste collection scheduling. Dynamic collection servicing routes are accordingly mapped for utilization by waste collection vehicles. During a tenday trial and validation period, it was observed that the proposed design increases fuel efficiency by up to 46% and a reduction in collection times by up to 18%. In addition to the noted quantitative improvements, the proposed scheme can also aid in optimizing long-term waste policies in smart city environments using the recorded statistics.","","978-1-5386-9425-1","10.1109/ECE.2018.8554985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8554985","Internet of Things;Machine Learning;Optimization Theory;Smart City","Monitoring;Energy conservation;Smart cities;Internet of Things;Waste management;Data analysis;Machine learning","data analysis;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);real-time systems;statistical analysis;ultrasonic transducers;waste management","IoT-enabled smart city waste management;machine learning analytics;real-time waste monitoring capability;back-end data analytics;realtime bin status;dynamic collection servicing routes;waste collection vehicles;internet of things paradigm;ultrasonic sensors;recorded statistics","","12","","10","IEEE","2 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the smart city solutions is to establish an efficient fleet management relating to the use of a fleet of vehicles (e.g., ambulances and police vehicles). The most basic function in a fleet management system is the real time vehicle tracking component. This component is usually the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) or the integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). To predict the position, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is generally applied using the sensor's measures and the GPS position as a helper. However, the DGPS high cost solution still suffers from GPS satellite signals loss due to multipath errors and the INS require more complex computing. Furthermore, the EKF performance depends on the vehicle dynamic variations and may quickly diverge because of environment changes (i.e, GPS failures by obstructions from building and trees). In this paper, we present a robust low cost approach using EKF and neural networks (NN) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reliably estimate the real time vehicle position using GPS enhanced with low cost Dead Reckoning (DR) sensors. While GPS signals are available, we train the NN with GA on different dynamics and outage times to learn the position errors so we can correct the future EKF predictions during GPS signal outages. We obtain empirically an improvement of up to 95% over the simple EKF predictions in case of GPS failures.","2327-1884","978-1-5090-0751-6","10.1109/CIST.2016.7804998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7804998","data fusion;Extended Kalman Filter;Global Positioning System;intelligent transportation systems;smart cities;Dead Reckoning;low cost;neural networks;Genetic Algorithm","Global Positioning System;Vehicles;Artificial neural networks;Genetic algorithms;Sensors;Kalman filters;Vehicle dynamics","genetic algorithms;Global Positioning System;intelligent transportation systems;Kalman filters;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;nonlinear filters;smart cities","GPS failures;GPS signal outages;EKF predictions;position errors;NN training;low cost dead reckoning sensors;genetic algorithm;EKF;neural networks;GPS position;global positioning system;vehicle tracking component;fleet management;urban population growth;information and communication technologies;evolutionary machine learning;extended Kalman filter;smart city;real time car positioning","","5","","15","IEEE","5 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we proposed a new method of web service discovery, which is based on the clustering and differential evolution algorithm. To carry out our study, firstly, we clustered the service set and identified the most similar class to narrow down the searching scope by calculating the semantic similarity between each class and the query. Second, the similarities of each service in the target class to the query are calculated by using different measurement methods, including Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Chebyshev distance and Bray Curtis distance. These results are used as the input of the differential evolution algorithm for our iterative simulation. Our findings show that compared with the traditional methods, our proposed approach that integrates the benefits of the clustering and differential evolution algorithm has a lower error, and is more consistent with the users' requirements.

The methods of machine learning are often used to detect fraudulent transactions from a larger amount of transaction data. However, the class imbalance problem reduces the performance of these methods. There are mainly four factors causing this problem: imbalanced class distribution, sample size, class separability and within-class concept. The existing improvement strategies for class imbalance mainly focus on the first factor but omit other three ones. This paper considers the four factors to propose a comprehensive model called clustering tree. Constructing a clustering tree includes two steps: 1) we first select a clustering algorithm considering the class separability; and then 2) we use this clustering algorithm to construct a tree that can be used to determine if an incoming transaction is illegal. The root node of this tree contains all samples, and we consider both the imbalanced class distribution and the within-class concept when samples are hierarchically divided into sub-nodes during the constructing process. We compare the proposed method with five state-of-the-art ones on two real transaction datasets, and the experimental results show that our method works better.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855347","Class imbalance, Machine learning, Clustering tree, Fraud detection","Clustering algorithms;Vegetation;Law;Companies;Support vector machines;Machine learning","computer crime;electronic commerce;fraud;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;retail data processing;transaction processing;trees (mathematics)","mobile communications;online transactions;transaction fraud detection;machine learning;fraudulent transactions;class imbalance problem;clustering tree;clustering algorithm;payment methods;Internet;e-commerce;online shopping;phishing","","6","","28","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing edge computing approaches rely on pre-trained static models and are limited in supporting diverse classes of edge devices as well as learning models to support them. This research proposes a novel crowd-based learning framework which allows edge devices with diverse resource capabilities to perform machine learning towards the realization of image-based smart city applications.

Due to the high complexity and huge amount of data involved in financial applications, the critical task of constructing appropriate machine learning models will surely become more challenging. Typically, data scientists or researchers may employ various optimizers to enhance the feature selection and/or tuning of the involved hyper-parameters in order to improve the overall performance of the obtained learning models. In this paper, a very flexible optimizer, namely the Adaptive Multi-Population optimization Algorithm (AMPOA), utilizing multiple populations with different search strategies is considered in which two of its variants are carefully evaluated with the other state-of-theart optimizers to enhance the feature selection process of the commonly used K-nearest-neighbor classifier approach on a set of 12 well-known benchmark problems. The first variant named the BAMPOA-R approach employs a rounding technique to determine on the binary decision of choosing an input feature or not for the underlying classifier while the other BAMPOA- T approach utilizes a specific transform function to decide on the feature selection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed optimizer for financial applications, the BAMPOA- R approach with the best performance in the previous test is integrated with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) as the BAMPOA-R-SVR algorithm to compare against other regressors on 10 major financial market indexes. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the remarkable performance of the proposed AMPOA approach to enhance the prediction performances of the underlying machine learning models through more vigorous feature selection for numerous real-world applications including those challenging problems in computational finance.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407936","binary optimization;feature selection;machine learning;metaheuristic algorithms;stock market prediction","Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Feature extraction","feature selection;financial data processing;nearest neighbour methods;optimisation;pattern classification;regression analysis;stock markets;support vector machines","adaptive multipopulation optimization algorithm;machine learning models;computational finance;learned data patterns;financial applications;data scientists;flexible optimizer;feature selection process;BAMPOA-R approach;input feature;BAMPOA- T approach;BAMPOA- R approach;BAMPOA-R-SVR algorithm;K-nearest-neighbor classifier approach;support vector regression;financial market indexes;search strategies","","2","","25","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reviewing the existing architecture of DML, Parametric server(PS) architecture stands out in iterative convergence algorithms and widely deployed in practice, thanks to flexible expansion and so on. Under this architecture, the parameter synchronization mode based on Bulk Synchronous Parallel(BSP) has become one of the research hotspots. As for the BSP mode, each iteration efficiency is determined by the slowest node in the cluster, therefore, the straggler problem becomes the main reason for reducing the efficiency of DML training, which is even more prominent in the heterogeneous cloud services. Existing works mainly focus on the straggler problem, and the importance of communication is usually ignored. However, inefficient communication is also one of the reasons for the inefficiency of DML iterations. In this paper, we propose DSANA, which first alleviates certain straggler problems by dynamically scheduling computation tasks. Secondly, DSANA improves the overlap of computation/communication by dividing larger transmission parameters, thus further improving the iteration efficiency of DML training. We conduct comparison experiments with the classic iterative algorithm PageRank on four different-scale data sets in two cloud service scenarios. The experimental results show that DSANA can improve the training efficiency to 36.6%$\sim$ 56.4% compared with the baseline solution.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00037","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408059","Distributed Machine Learning;Parameter Server;Bulk Synchronous Parallel;Straggler;Dynamic Scheduling;Network Acceleration","Training;Machine learning algorithms;Processor scheduling;Training data;Computer architecture;Machine learning;Dynamic scheduling","cloud computing;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel algorithms;pattern clustering","DSANA;acceleration solution;dynamic scheduling;network acceleration;growing training data;existing architecture;iterative convergence algorithms;flexible expansion;parameter synchronization mode;research hotspots;BSP mode;iteration efficiency;slowest node;straggler problem;DML training;heterogeneous cloud services;inefficient communication;DML iterations;larger transmission parameters;classic iterative algorithm PageRank;different-scale data sets;cloud service scenarios;baseline solution","","1","","35","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose to apply the sustainable approach in the Network security architecture through augmentation of cloud, networks and end-point level, our approach provides a robust and ultra-elastic mechanism of security that surpasses the prevailing architecture. We evaluated the feasibility and performance of the security stack containing a machine learning component, Elastic search engine, Kibana and Logstash as the building blocks of the architecture. Based on our survey, SUESSA architecture overcomes the disadvantages of current architecture specifically solving the problem of sustainability strongly demanded in security architecture of the future smart cities.","","978-1-7281-9919-1","10.1109/CANDARW51189.2020.00079","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355840","Sustainable & Elastic Security Architecture;Holistic Approach;Super Smart City;Future Cities;Artificial Intelligence","Machine learning algorithms;Smart cities;Architecture;Computer architecture;Machine learning;Security;Sustainable development","application program interfaces;computer network security;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);search engines;smart cities","future security challenges;communication networks;sustainability;prevailing security practices;sustainable approach;Network security architecture;prevailing architecture;security stack;Elastic search engine;SUESSA architecture;future smart cities;securing IoT networks;super smart city;city planners;novel Sustainable Ultra-Elastic Stack Security Architecture","","2","","18","IEEE","22 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the theory of machine learning is introduced in the practice of tax risk management, and the model of tax risk identification based on PSO-BP (Particle Swarm Optimization-Back Propagation) algorithm is established. 1350 tax households are randomly selected in this paper. Among these tax households, 1000 of them are training data, and the rest of them are testing data.

One of the main challenges for successful and efficient training and inference on edge devices is the careful selection of parameters to build local Machine Learning (ML) models. To this aim, we propose a Particle Swarm optimization (PSO)-based technique to optimize the hyperparameter settings for the local ML models in an FL environment. We evaluate the performance of our proposed technique using two case studies. First, we consider smart city services, and use an experimental transportation dataset for traffic prediction as a proxy for this setting. Second, we consider Industrial IoT(IIoT) services, and use the real-time telemetry dataset to predict the probability that a machine will fail shortly due to component failures. Our experiments indicate that PSO provides an efficient approach for tuning the hyperparameters of deep Long short-term memory (LSTM) models when compared to the grid search method. Our experiments illustrate that the number of client-server communication rounds to explore the landscape of configurations to find the near-optimal parameters are greatly reduced (roughly by two orders of magnitude needing only 2%-4% of the rounds compared to state of the art non-PSO-based approaches). We also demonstrate that utilizing the proposed PSO-based technique to find the near-optimal configurations for FL and centralized learning models does not adversely affect the accuracy of the models.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322464","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322464","Federated Learning;Deep Learning;Particle Swarm Optimization;Parameter Optimization;IoT;Smart Services","Optimization;Training;Neurons;Performance evaluation;Particle swarm optimization;Data privacy;Data models","inference mechanisms;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;recurrent neural nets;smart cities;town and country planning","nonPSO-based approaches;learning models;near-optimal configurations;PSO-based technique;near-optimal parameters;client-server communication rounds;deep long short-term memory models;real-time telemetry dataset;traffic prediction;experimental transportation dataset;FL environment;local ML models;hyperparameter settings;particle swarm optimization-based technique;local machine learning models;edge devices;inference;efficient local training;critical matter;global optimization;smart city services;particle swarm optimized federated learning","","24","","30","IEEE","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The traditional way to manage WSNs is not suitable for this type of applications, because manually managing and monitoring every single sensor would be too expensive, time consuming and error prone. Moreover, unattended sensors may suffer of several issues that progressively make their measures unreliable and consequently useless. For this reason, several automatically techniques have been studied and implemented for the detection and correction of measurements from sensors which are affected by errors caused by aging and/or drift. These methods are grouped under the name of self-calibration techniques. This paper presents a distributed system, which combines an incremental machine learning technique with a non-linear Kalman Filter estimator, which allows to automatically re-calibrate sensors leveraging the correlation with measurements made by neighbor sensors.

Taking into account recommendation services through mobile applications, this paper proposes a more dynamic and occupant-centered solution, which not only offers useful energy related recommendations, but also adjusts the moment the recommendation is sent to maximize the receptiveness of the user in order to achieve the optimal energy behavior change. These moments are redefined micro-moments in terms of energy behavior change and occur when three factors' conditions coincide, the location, the physical and the mobile activity of the user. We develop a mobile application which can monitor them and detect a potential micro-moment, when a notification could be pushed to the user. The location is periodically collected from the device's sensors, the physical activity is inferred with the use of Google Activity Recognition API, while the mobile activity is inferred utilizing mobile event triggers and usage statistics.

One of the promising applications of the integration of IoT and AI is smart city. The typical design pattern of smart cities is to install cameras and various sensors as many spots as possible and connect them to data center servers that can make smart decisions based on the inputs from the cameras and sensors. In such structure, network bandwidth may hinder the real-time processing because sensory data should be sent to the servers in the remote location before making any decision. To solve this problem, recent a few studies demonstrated edge computing. In edge computing, IoT devices can handle basic recognition. Thus, only sophisticated inputs that are not handled by IoT devices are sent to remote servers. In this paper, we demonstrate that the edge computing can provide stand-alone processing power for handling one of the fundamental applications of smart city, which is street object detection. Correct detection of various street objects is the core function of traffic systems and public safety applications of smart cities. A convolutional neural network model is developed by training with traffic data captured at California and Nebraska.

The IoT paradigm, enhanced with intelligence and big data analytics, has found applications in a wide range of solutions such as smart home, smart city, industrial IoT etc. Even though IoT implies that cheap motes can conduct a specific task, thus a large number of them can be deployed, we aim to minimize the installed hardware while we still have a high level of quality of service. Machine Learning algorithms can support this challenge by generating virtual data via utilization of real data from a smaller subset of sensors. The generated data can replicate sensor behavior which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to track. It is also possible to use simulation models for data analysis model validation, by generating new data under varying conditions. In this paper, we propose a concept of an IoT testbed which allows virtual IoT resources to be immersed and tested in real life conditions, which are met in everyday life. Additionally, the features of the implemented testbed prototype are discussed while taking into account specific use cases, regarding luminosity scenarios in industrial environments.","2325-2944","978-1-7281-0570-3","10.1109/DCOSS.2019.00126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8804746","virtual sensor, light sensor, machine learning","Sensors;Machine learning algorithms;Data models;Correlation;Buildings;Machine learning;Informatics","Big Data;data analysis;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);virtualisation","virtual light sensors;industrial environment;private sector;industrial sector;big data analytics;smart home;smart city;virtual data;data analysis model validation;virtual IoT resources;machine learning algorithms","","2","","13","IEEE","19 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here, the data and the information are shared employing Knowledge Graphs, that are becoming a key enabler for large-scale processing of massive collections of interrelated facts. Examples include the Google Knowledge Graph with dozens of billion facts, dataCommons, DBPedia, YAGO, and Knowledge Vault, a very large scale probabilistic knowledge graph created with information extraction methods for unstructured or semi-structured information. Specifically, Knowledge Graphs provide the means of development of the newest methods for data management, data fusion, data merging, and graph and network optimization and modeling, serving as a source of high quality data and a base for information integration.In particular, Knowledge Graphs help to infer new relationships out of existing facts, giving context and meaning to the content, and can be used in applications. For example, the data generated by a computer vision system could be semantically represented and shared across numerous systems, taking into account the needs and requirements of these systems, as well as the context, provenance, licensing and consent aspects of the generated data.

In contrast to long-term traffic prediction, accurate prediction of short-term traffic flow facilitates timely traffic management and rapid response. We develop and study a novel ensemble model (EM) based on long short term memory (LSTM), deep autoencoder (DAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Our approach takes into account both temporal and spatial characteristics of the traffic conditions. We evaluate our proposal against well-known existing prediction models. We use two real traffic data (California and London roadways) with different characteristics to train and test the models.

These applications are usually characterized by a sequential stream of data, unlike the classical ML scenario in which the entire data is available during training. For such applications, Stream-based Active Learning (SAL) has been designed as a type of supervised ML in which an expert is asked to label the most informative instances as they arrive. Previous SAL techniques assume that the expert is always available and always labels the data correctly. However, in several applications, such as those mentioned above, the SAL activity interweaves with the everyday life of regular residents, who are often not experts, and may also not always be willing to participate in the labeling process. In this paper, we discuss the importance of user-centered ML, and show how taking into account realistic models of user behavior significantly improves the accuracy and reduces the training period of smart environment applications based on SAL.

Automatic detection of road traffic events using Twitter data mining is one such area of a great many applications and enormous potential, albeit facing major challenges concerning the management and analysis of big data (volume, velocity, variety, and veracity). Various approaches on the subject have been proposed in recent years, but the methods and outcomes are in their infancy. This paper proposes a method for automatic detection of road traffic related events from tweets in the Saudi dialect using machine learning and big data technologies. Firstly, we build and train a classifier using three machine learning algorithms, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and logistic regression, to filter tweets into relevant and irrelevant. Subsequently, we train other classifiers to detect multiple types of events including accident, roadwork, road closure, road damage, traffic condition, fire, weather, and social events. The results from the analysis of one million tweets show that our method is able to detect road traffic events, as well as their location and time, automatically, without any prior knowledge of the events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on traffic event detection from Arabic tweets using machine learning and the Apache Spark big data platform.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060213","Twitter data analysis, Smart transportation, Event detection, Smart cities, Machine learning, Text mining, Big data analytics, Apache Spark, MongoDB, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regressio","Event detection;Roads;Twitter;Big Data;Machine learning;Support vector machines","Big Data;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;road traffic control;social networking (online);support vector machines;traffic engineering computing","smart societies;automatic detection;road traffic events;Twitter data mining;machine learning;Big Data technologies;support vector machine;road closure;road damage;traffic condition;social events;tweets;Apache Spark Big Data platform;road traffic event detection;road transportation","","15","","32","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A performance evaluation method named GPUPerfML is proposed, which combines decision tree and theoretical analytical model to locate performance bottlenecks of GPU applications and guide application optimization. Based on its feature selection, decision tree is used to extract the sorted influential features from a large number of features. The proposed theoretical analysis model defines the categories of performance issues and establishes mapping relationships between features and performance issues, so as to quickly and directly identify performance bottlenecks. Besides, theoretical analysis can be used to guide decision tree building and features analysis, which improves and guarantees the accuracy of the proposed method.

Various services can be served through UAV, such as information collection in disaster area or traffic monitoring in smart city. However, on-board computation resource and the battery lifetime of UAV are limited. For that reason, there is a limit to perform analysis, such as, machine learning using collected data. In this situation, UAV can get help from an adjacent Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) server that has computing resources. However, the closest MEC server does not always guarantee optimal computing performance and communication efficiency. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose the overall system of machine learning based UAV to MEC computation offloading for data analyzing. First, we define the problems into two. Firstly, we define two problems 1) matching UAV and task cluster in consideration of energy efficiency. 2) Finding optimal MEC server to offload the task to minimize the total processing time and energy consumption.

POIs are mostly used on location based social media applications, especially for place recommendation. Social media users share the places they like and discovering such new POIs has importance for understanding the taste and preference of city citizens and for understanding the city. An important problem is, in a given social media message, detecting which word can be POI. This process of retrieving points of interest from a text is called POI extraction. In this work, we propose methods to extract POIs from microblogs. We explore both machine learning and artificial neural network based approaches. As machine learning approach, we use Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for sequential tagging. We investigate the effect of various additional features such as sentiment of tweets, POI density and population density of the location where the tweet was posted. We also use built-in features of CRF. As a hybrid approach, we generate word embeddings by Word2vec and apply K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm on the vectors constructed. Finally we construct a deep, feed-forward neural network to extract POIs from microblog text. These techniques are applied on a collection of tweets in Turkish posted by users from Ankara. Experimental results show that CRF constructed with POI density feature outperforms CRF with other feature sets along with other neural network approaches in terms of POI extraction accuracy.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397551","","Feature extraction;Neural networks;Social network services;Sociology;Statistics;Urban areas;Machine learning","feedforward neural nets;location based services;nearest neighbour methods;pattern classification;random processes;social networking (online)","location based social media applications;place recommendation;CRF;POI density feature;POI extraction accuracy;point of interest;machine learning;artificial neural network;Conditional Random Fields;sequential tagging;K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm;Word2vec;deep feed-forward neural network;microblog text","","1","","9","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the ways of finding citizen problems with their locations by using tweet data is discussed. Tweets in Turkish language from the Aegean Region of Turkey were used for the study. It is aimed to form a smart system, which detects problems of citizens and extracts the problems' exact locations from tweet texts. Firstly, the collected data was analyzed to get information of any city event, citizen's complaint or requests about a problem. After the possibility of detecting tweets, which have any city problem, was ensured, two datasets were created. The first one consists of the tweets that have an event information or a problem and the second one has the tweets, which have other information not related to our study. Then Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the annotated tweets and was tested on a separate set of tweets. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure of the classifier is given. A location recognizer, which finds the Turkish place names in a text, is created and applied on the tweets that are marked as information-containing by the classifier to detect the location of the problem precisely. The first findings of the project is promising. The high accuracy, which is obtained by the classifier, shows that it is proper to use this classifier for our study. The location recognizer is planned to be improved and place names on the real-time tweet data is to be detected.","","978-1-5386-4478-2","10.1109/SGCF.2018.8408936","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8408936","Data Analysis;Machine Learning;Smart Cities;Social Media Analysis;Text Mining","Twitter;Smart cities;Machine learning;Smart grids;Transportation","Bayes methods;location based services;pattern classification;smart cities;social networking (online)","location recognizer;real-time tweet data;citizen problems;twitter data;smart city management;annotated tweets;social network;Turkish language;Naive Bayes classifier","","8","","19","IEEE","12 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The FIFO-guided warning order can process warnings timely when disk failures are rare in data centers. With the growing scale of data centers, the increasing number of disk failures leads to a complex situation that multiple warnings are raised simultaneously, where the FIFO-guided warning order neither processes warnings timely, nor manages warnings properly due to lack of the priority of warnings. Thus, a real-time and finer-grained priority guidance for warning order management is an urgent need. To this end, we turn our attention to the failures since each warning corresponds to a fail event. The key insight is that the interdependence of failures, i.e., the order failure occurred, indicates the order of warning processing. With an accurate failure order, data centers can decrease the probability of data loss and the downtime of latency-sensitive applications by processing urgent warnings in advance. In this paper, we predict the failure order with a LambdaMART model, which is a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm in information retrieval. To avoid overly concerning on the correctness of high-rank warnings in information retrieval, we design a symmetric metric to evaluate the prediction evaluation of failure order. Experiment on a public dataset, provided by the Backblaze company, shows that our model outperforms the FIFO order and the order from previous DFP models.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855417","Disk Failure Prediction, SMART, Learning to Rank, LambdaMART","Data centers;Predictive models;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement;Information retrieval;Prediction algorithms;Conferences","computer centres;data handling;failure analysis;information retrieval","order failure;warning processing;data centers;data loss;FIFO order;disk failure processing;disk failure prediction;FIFO-guided warning order;warning order management;LambdaMART model;ranking algorithm;information retrieval","","","","25","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is solid evidence that the vast majority of such malicious bot traffic comes from data centers. The malicious bot deployed on the hosts of data centers is referred to as a CloudBot. How to detect and block CloudBots effectively has become an urgent problem in practice, while the research on it can be seldom seen in public. To this end, we propose a traffic-based quasi-real-time method for CloudBot detection using machine learning, which exploits a new sample partitioning approach, as well as innovative multi-layer features that reveal the essential difference between CloudBots and human traffic. Our method achieves 93.4% precision in the experiment and performs well on the real-world dataset, which proves to be effective to detect unknown CloudBots and combat the concept drift caused by varying time. Besides, the approach is also privacy-preserving without using any specific application layer information.

Also, timely prediction of pollutants level can help government agencies to take proactive measures to protect the environment. In this paper we have proposed the application of Internet of Things and Machine learning so that air pollution can be monitored within future smart cities. A high correlation between pollutants and weather parameters is determined by using Pearson correlation. In contrary to traditional sensor network, this work utilizes cloud-centric IoT middleware architecture that not only receives data from air pollution sensors but also from existing weather sensors. Thus provides two-fold reliability and reduce the cost substantially. The Artificial Neural Network has been used to predict the level of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Particular Matter (PM2.5). Promising results suggest that ANN is a reliable candidate that can be used in air pollution monitoring and prediction system.

In smart cities, timely and precise air pollution levels knowledge is vital for the successful setup of smart pollution systems. Recently, pollution and weather data in smart city have been bursting, and we have truly got into the era of big data. Ozone is considered as one of the most air pollutants with hurtful impact to human health. Existing methods used to predict the level of ozone uses shallow pollution prediction models and are still unsatisfactory in their accuracy to be used in many real-world applications. In order to increase the accuracy of prediction models we come up with the concept of using deep architecture models tested on big pollution and weather data. In this paper, a new deep learning-based ozone level prediction model is proposed, which considers the pollution and weather correlations integrally. This deep learning model is used to learn ozone level features, and it is trained using a grid search technique. A deep architecture model is utilized to represent ozone level features for prediction. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that the proposed method for ozone level prediction has superior performance.

Due to its non-linear I-V and P-V characteristics, the PV Generator output varies with both solar radiation and temperature. In order to compensate for the low conversion efficiency, various MPPT algorithms are developed that provide automated control over power interfaces to generate optimal power efficiency. It is used to adjust the panels in order to promote solar operating voltage close to MPP under changing day to day weather conditions.

For example, in mapping a parallel for loop to hardware, OpenMP 4 offers commands for exploiting vector instructions (simd directives) and automatic GPU offloading (target directives), as well as schedule directives for CPU load balancing. These benefits come with a cost. A developer has to be well aware of the architecture details, and the application, and must iteratively tune to determine the best combination of pragma directives delivering higher performance for the given target architecture. Hence in this paper we introduce Rigel, a framework that automates these decisions to arrive at optimized OpenMP annotated code. Given a code segment with inherent parallelism, our framework uses separate machine learning classification models to predict the anticipated benefit of each optimization. Both Vector Classification and GPU Offloading Classification models perform with average accuracies of 83%. Succeeding the classification process, code segments are optimized accordingly. Our results show that GPU offloading optimization lead to an average speedup of 8x over default non-optimized CPU parallel execution (pragma omp parallel for) and average Vector optimization speedup is 6x compared to LLVM Clang 4.0 auto-vectorization. Furthermore Scheduling mechanism selection process results in overall accuracy of 90%.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855553","OpenMP;Clang;Performance Tunining;parallel programming;machine learning;GPU","Feature extraction;Graphics processing units;Optimization;Hardware;Machine learning;Tuning;Computer architecture","graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);message passing;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;pattern classification;scheduling;shared memory systems","simd directives;machine learning classification models;vector classification;hardware architectures;OpenMP 4;directive scheduling;GPU offloading classification models;scheduling mechanism selection process;OpenMP performancetuning;shared memory multiprocessing;C application;C++ application;vector instructions;performance portability;shared memory;Clang 4.0 auto-vectorization;default nonoptimized CPU parallel execution;GPU offloading optimization lead;classification process;code segment;optimized OpenMP;Rigel;pragma directives;CPU load balancing;target directives;automatic GPU offloading","","2","","31","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the basis of the initial partition scheme, a manual intervention scheme suitable for the procedure is developed according to the importance of procedure, and a new performance evaluation model is used to theoretically evaluate obtained speedups, so that the best partitioning schemes of procedures are identified, exploring the intrinsic law that characteristics of procedures influence their best partitioning schemes. The paper does research from three aspects: calculating importance of procedures, generating the best partitioning schemes of procedures, and building a performance evaluation model, in order to fully exploit the potential parallelism for irregular programs.

Apache Spark has more than 180 configuration parameters, which can be adjusted by users according to their own specific application so as to optimize the performance. Currently these parameters are tuned manually by trial and error, which is ineffective due to the large parameter space and the complex interactions among the parameters. In this paper, in order to make the parameter tuning process of Spark more effective, a novel method for tuning configuration of Spark based on machine learning is proposed, which is composed of binary classification and multi-classification. This method can be used to auto-tune the configuration parameters of Spark. Furthermore, several common machine learning algorithms based on the proposed method are explored, and experimental results show that decision tree model (C5.0) is the best model considering the accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, the experimental results also show that the performance can get average 36% gain with the proposed method compared with the default configuration of Spark.","","978-1-5090-4297-5","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828429","Apache spark;configuration parameter;machine learning","Sparks;Data models;Tuning;Predictive models;Computational modeling;Big data;Optimization methods","data structures;decision trees;distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;public domain software","tuning configuration parameters;machine learning;Apache Spark;open source distributed data processing;distributed memory abstraction;binary classification;multiclassification;decision tree model","","54","","19","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We believe RL is an ideal approach since this task falls under the control-optimization problem where RL has yielded optimal results in previous work. The magnitude and scale of a DH system complexity incurs the curse of dimensionalities and model, hereby making RL a good choice since it provides a solution for the problem. To assist RL even further with the curse of dimensionalities, we intend to investigate the use of SL to reduce the state space. To achieve this, we shall use historical data to generate a heat load sub-model for each home. We believe using the output of these sub-models as feedback to the RL algorithm could significantly reduce the complexity of the learning task. Also, it could reduce convergence time for the RL algorithm. The desired goal is to achieve a realtime application, which takes operational actions when it receives new direct feedback. However, considering the dynamics of DH system such as large time delay and dissipation in DH network due to various factors, we hope to investigate things such as the appropriate data sampling rate and new parameters / sensors that could improve knowledge about the state of the system, especially on the consumer side of the DH network.","","978-1-4799-2736-4","10.1109/PerComW.2014.6815206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6815206","Pervasive computing;reinforcement learning;online supervised learning;district heating system;smart city","DH-HEMTs;Space heating;Water heating;Cogeneration;Learning (artificial intelligence);Load modeling","district heating;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing","machine learning;district heating system energy optimization;RL;reinforcement learning;online supervised learning;SL;DH systems;control-optimization problem;curse-of-dimensionalities;heat load submodel;learning task complexity;time delay;DH network dissipation","","10","","15","IEEE","15 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several current techniques could be used to improve the accuracy of Fingerprinting such as Machine Learning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL). In this paper, we propose an BLE iBeacon-based indoor localization system using Fingerprinting method. The system applies k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) - an ML algorithm to decide the user position. In order to reduce the computational cost and ensure the accuracy of the system, we propose to use lightweight feature vectors that include information of the nearest beacons and device azimuth for training Machine Learning algorithm.

This research addresses the parking problems faced in most of the cities and growing colleges like University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). In this study, segmented images of parking spaces occupied by cars as well as available empty lots were extracted as spatial information and fed to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based Deep Learning framework. We expect this incorporation of spatial-temporal information would enhance the classification performance of CNNs. For proof-of concept, performance will be validated on a free parking lot dataset-PKLot from Universidade Federal do Parana in Brazil. After desired classification performance is achieved, our robust CNN classification framework can be deployed on a cloud server to classify images in real-time. We also plan to release a parking-support mobile application (Android/IOS) that would display the real-time grid layout of empty and occupied parking spots using GPS information of the user. This app will be constantly updated based on parking information from the cloud-classifier. We expect that the outcome of this study will assist people in managing their time efficiently in finding their closest parking spot.

In many cases, these people lost their motion ability and consciousness. For example, after a strong earthquake struck, people might first be hit by heavy objects or forced down by dropped objects, and then lost consciousness. The situation becomes dangerous if trapped people cannot be detected and pull out in time. Therefore, finding trapped victims inside a building in time becomes a very important issue for responders and command centers. Due to the popularity of video surveillance systems, several image-based methods have been proposed to detect trapped people by using machine learning technology to identify human features. However, trapped victims were usually covered by fallen objects. Detecting human features of trapped victims could be difficult. In this paper, we proposed, Indoor Trapped-Victim Detection System (iTEDS), an image recognition system to identify and recognize trapped victims inside a building. Given a video, we track people and big objects, such as bookcases, tables, chests and so on, inside a building. If a huge object falls on top of a person and makes the person unable to move for a while, we mark the person as a trapped victim. In order to investigate the effectiveness of iTEDS, we applied iTEDS to the accident that a dresser fell on twin boys. Our results showed that iTEDS successfully identified the trapped boys underneath the dresser.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397395","Image processing;Rescue system;Human detection;In-home child care","Tracking;Buildings;Feature extraction;Histograms;Accidents;Streaming media;Security","emergency services;feature extraction;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;video surveillance","iTEDS;image recognition system;machine learning technology;image-based methods;video surveillance system;trapped victim;trapped people;Indoor trapp ed-victim detection system","","5","","14","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As one of the most typical security events, hard landing is extremely concerned by airlines and related studies have received extensive attention in recent years. However, existing regression or risk based models either suffers from low prediction accuracy, or cannot provide good interpretability, making themselves impractical in real applications. To solve these problems, in this paper we propose CurveCluster: a curve clustering-based approach which is able to automatically recognize hard landing patterns from quick access recorder (QAR) data. We first provide a two-level hierarchical classification of hard landing events based on different hard landing patterns. Then we extract curve features from several key QAR parameters through interpolation and resampling. Finally, we apply K-means clustering algorithm on the curve features to automatically recognize the hard landing patterns. We test our approach on a dataset of 9,203 A320 flight QAR data samples and the overall recognition accuracy reaches up to 93.1%. Moreover, our results directly reflect the reasons of different types of hard landing events, which show strong interpretability.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00141","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060137","hard landing;QAR data;K-means clustering;interpolation;curve clustering","Feature extraction;Interpolation;Atmospheric modeling;Pattern recognition;Aircraft;Machine learning;Safety","aerospace computing;aerospace safety;data handling;data recording;feature extraction;pattern classification;pattern clustering;regression analysis;travel industry","CurveCluster;QAR curve;regression based model;curve clustering;quick access recorder data;hard landing events;curve feature extraction;203 A320 flight QAR data samples;hard landing patterns;risk based model;flight safety;aviation industry;k-means clustering","","7","","19","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The motivation behind this graph-based paradigm is to decouple algorithms (vision pipelines and data flow among them) from schedules (runtime) so that exploiting parallelism and locality through optimizations such as tiling becomes more feasible. While OpenVX allows benefits from tiling easily through a provided tiling extension, crafting an optimal tile size selection (TSS) model is still challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity between tile size and performance. In this paper, we propose a neural network model that utilizes unique access patterns in OpenVX applications to learn and predict optimal tile sizes effectively. Our mechanism extracts optimal features from raw profiling data such that it maximizes the clustering quality of vision operators, thereby generating highly accurate TSS models. The experimental evaluations using both individual kernels and full application benchmarks show that our proposed model predicts optimal tile sizes accurately; the prediction error is 10% in the worst case, and mostly around 3%. More importantly, compared with previous TSS methods based on analytical models and the state-of-the-art neural network approach, our proposed method can predict optimal tile size for vision applications with better accuracy and less inference time.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00077","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9408026","tiling;machine learning;OpenVX;performance optimization","Computer vision;Schedules;Runtime;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Pipelines;Predictive models","computer vision;embedded systems;feature extraction;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;pattern clustering","embedded vision applications;graph-based programming models;high-performance computer vision algorithms;embedded platforms;decouple algorithms;vision pipelines;data flow;optimizations;OpenVX applications;vision operators;highly accurate TSS models;neural network-based optimal tile size selection model;feature extraction;clustering quality","","1","","33","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Urban structures are basically the usual offices, houses, apartments etc. A generalized word for all these buildings can be urban structures. This classification problem was identified by our team while making our way into the visual positioning system, we saw that the visual landmark recognition of urban structures was an unexplored domain by using deep learning approaches. We also Identified that unlike the landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Statue Of Liberty etc, urban structures were difficult to learn by a neural network, the data requirements were quite distinct compared to the ones mentioned for all these famous landmarks around the globe. Most of all the landmark database was created, augmented, labelled and preprocessed in lab. The transfer learning based approaches were not that useful since the overall size of the model would always be so enormous and integration of a transfer learning based model would be meaningless for any deployed web app or even for a local mobile based app. By collecting and engineering our own data using a data collection app, we have proposed a neural architecture which can be configured to learn multiple number of urban landmarks while retaining its overall size under 60MBs. This was achieved by a Convolutional Neural Network based binary classification model trained on landmarks existing in our university.

Thanks to the today's technologies, it is possible to collect real-time data to monitor the traffic situation in some specific areas. An important challenge in ITS is the ability to predict road traffic variables. The short-term predictions of traffic aspects are a complex nonlinear task that has been the subject of many research efforts in the past few decades. Accessing to precise traffic flow data is mandatory for a large number of applications which have to guarantee high level of services such as: traffic flow reconstruction, which in turn is used to perform what-if analysis, conditioned routing, etc. They have to be reliable and precise for sending rescue teams and fire brigades. This paper proposes a solution for a short- and long-term traffic flow prediction estimation by using and comparing a number of machine learning approaches.

Taxicabs are vital public services in large cities that are taken by passengers thousands of times every day. Reducing the number of vacant vehicles on the streets will help service providers to raise drivers' incomes, reduce energy consumption, optimize traffic efficiency, and control air pollution problems in large cities. Since drivers do not have enough information about the location of passengers and other taxis, most of them might drive to the same area. Due to the lack of passenger information, they often end up without picking up any passengers while there are highly demanded areas in their neighborhood. To address these issues, machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze mobility data acquired from the IoT sensors and help companies to organize the taxi fleet or minimize the wait-time for both passengers and drivers in the city. In this paper, an LSTM-based deep sequence learning model is applied to forecast taxi-demand in a particular urban area in a smart city. For this purpose, points of interest (POIs) in the city are extracted from Google Maps and integrated with the mobility data sources. Given a real-world dataset and two evaluation metrics, we observed that taxi-demand in each urban area can be influenced by external factors such as neighborhood locations and the POIs located in that area. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the vanilla LSTM model and has less average error than baseline methods in terms of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE).","0730-3157","978-1-7281-7303-0","10.1109/COMPSAC48688.2020.000-7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9202791","Urban Mobility Prediction, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, LSTM, POI","Public transportation;Time series analysis;Urban areas;Predictive models;Data models;Computer architecture;Microprocessors","energy consumption;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;mobile computing;recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;traffic engineering computing","taxi demand prediction;LSTM-based deep sequence model;urban mobility;city planning;mobility services;passenger information;machine learning techniques;taxi fleet;LSTM-based deep sequence learning model;smart city;mobility data sources;vanilla LSTM model;mean squared error;symmetric mean absolute percentage error","","7","","19","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the potential benefits and the relevance of real world studies (RWS) with to the rapid development of data mining algorithms, as well as large-scale accumulated real world datasets. However, it is beyond the ability of traditional data mining algorithms to solve such large-scale RWS problems due to the large amount of data need to be processed and the difficulty in the problems solving, especially the nonconvex optimization problems. In many cases for these nonconvex problems, the goal is to find a reasonable local minimum, and the main concern is that the iterative updates are easily trapped in saddle points or bad local optima points. In this paper, we aim at minimizing the sum of a smooth nonlinear function and a block-separable nonconvex function involving a large number of block variables subjected to inequality constraints, which covers a wide range of interesting applications appearing in distributed optimization, statistics learning, etc. However, solving such a nonconvex nonlinear optimization problem associated with inequality constraints remains as a challenging task. This is because: 1) it is still an open problem about how to escape from saddle points and bad local optima points using a block coordinate descent method to deal with the nonconvex nonlinear optimization functions; 2) it can be extremely expensive to compute the entire block variables when the problem scale is large. Therefore, we propose a novel parallel first-order optimization method, called as Asynchronous block coordinate descent with Time Perturbation (ATP), which utilizing the time perturbation technique that escapes from saddle points and local optima points. We present a randomized block variable selection rule of the proposed method, as well as the iteration complexity. Experiments conducted on typical machine learning problems in RWS, i.e., folded concave linear regression, validate the efficacy of our optimization method. In particular, the experiment results demonstrate that time perturbation could greatly help the proposed algorithm escape from saddle points and local optima in the nonconvex part, which provides a promising way to tackle nonconvex optimization problems employing block coordinate descent.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855671","Nonconvex Optimization;Asynchronous Block Coordinate Descent Method;Time Perturbation;Real World Study","Optimization;Perturbation methods;Linear programming;Input variables;Data mining;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms","Big Data;concave programming;convex programming;data mining;gradient methods;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;regression analysis","large-scale nonconvex problem;big data;large-scale accumulated real world datasets;large-scale RWS problems;saddle points;smooth nonlinear function;block-separable nonconvex function;inequality constraints;distributed optimization;nonconvex nonlinear optimization functions;parallel first-order optimization method;randomized block variable selection rule;data mining algorithms;machine learning problems;real world studies;statistics learning;asynchronous block coordinate descent with time perturbation method;local optima points","","1","","24","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, BLE beacon networks suffer from short battery lifetime, inducing additional maintenance costs. Previous works have tackled this problem by proposing a more energy-efficient BLE beacon firmware that will change its operating configuration based on user existence information. However, previous efforts could not adapt to varying user traffic conditions and therefore was impractical. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel neural network-driven framework, User-P, that extends beacon lifetime by changing its operating configuration by predicting user traffic conditions.

Commercial, industrial and residential buildings often incorporate systems used to determine occupancy. However, relatively simple sensor technology and control algorithms limit the effectiveness of smart building services. In this paper we propose to replace sensor technology with time series models that can predict the number of occupants at a given location and time. We use Wi-Fi datasets readily available in abundance for smart building services and train Auto Regression Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) time series models. As a use case scenario of smart building services, these models allow forecasting of the number of people at a given time and location in 15, 30 and 60 minutes time intervals at building as well as Access Point (AP) level. For LSTM, we build our models in two ways: a separate model for every time scale, and a combined model for the three time scales. Our experiments show that LSTM combined model reduced the computational resources with respect to the number of neurons by 74.48 % for the AP level, and by 67.13 % for the building level. Further, the root mean square error (RMSE) was reduced by 88.2%-93.4% for LSTM in comparison to ARIMA for the building levels models and by 80.9 %-87% for the AP level models.","","978-1-5386-2588-0","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2017.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8291910","Time series;Machine Learning;ARIMA;LSTM;Smart Buildings;Smart Homes;IoT services;Wi-Fi networks","Time series analysis;Autoregressive processes;Computational modeling;Smart buildings;Wireless fidelity;Predictive models","autoregressive moving average processes;building management systems;buildings (structures);image sensors;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;neural nets;regression analysis;time series;wireless LAN","deep LSTM neural networks;Wi-Fi networks;smart buildings;smart building services;commercial buildings;industrial buildings;residential buildings;train Auto Regression Integrating Moving Average models;Long Short-Term Memory time series models;time scale;building levels models;time intervals;time 30.0 min;time 60.0 min;time 15 min","","22","","24","IEEE","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Researchers try to recognize human emotions effectively to protect the passenger's personal safety. Most of the current approaches are intrusive to passengers, e.g. using camera to capture passenger's facial expression or identifying conversation between passenger and driver. In this paper, we study the intonation and speed of speech signal to recognize three emotions, which are 'Neutrality', 'Happiness' and 'Anger'. Our proposed method contains two stages to make classification. In stage one, we distinguish between passenger and driver using unsupervised spectral clustering method. Experimental results show that the accuracy of our method is superior to representative off-the-shelf methods. In stage two, we propose a CNNs-based emotion recognition method.

KERMIT optimizes in real-time YARN memory and CPU allocations to individual YARN containers by analysing container response-time performance. Unlike previous automatic tuning methods for specific systems such as Spark or Hadoop, this is the first study that focuses on the more general case of on-line, real-time tuning of YARN container density and how this affects performance of applications running on YARN. KERMIT employs the same tuning code to automatically tune any system that uses YARN, including both Spark and Hadoop.

In this paper, we propose a Spatial Temporal Long-and Short-Term Network (STLSN) model employing deep learning method to predict crowd flow in high precision. The proposed STLSN considers both short and long term temporal dependencies, and it employs local Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to capture spatial correlations between regions.

Key information is then synthesized in the cloud from them to create a real-time city-wide traffic palette. Real-time or offline processing both at the edge and the cloud will then be leveraged to optimize intersection operations, manage network traffic, identify near-collisions between various units of traffic, provide street parking information, and a host of other applications. Additional information such as weather and environment will also be leveraged. The use of edge-based real-time machine learning (ML) techniques and videostream processing has several significant advantages. (1) Because there is no need to store copious amounts of video (few minutes typically suffice for edge-based processing), it automatically addresses concerns of public agencies who do not want person-identifiable information to be stored for reasons of citizen privacy and legality. (2) The processing of the video stream at the edge will allow for the use of low bandwidth communication using wireline and wireless networks to a central system such as a cloud, resulting in a compressed and holistic picture of the entire city.

We focus on an edge computing system that conduct distributed deep learning tasks using gradient descent based approaches. To ensure the system's performance, there are at least two major challenges to cope with: how to offload the training jobs with multiple data source nodes and how to allocate the limited resources on each edge server among training jobs. In this paper, we jointly consider the two challenges, aiming to maximize the system throughput while ensuring the system's quality of service (QoS).

LOF aims to forecast the imminent faults of an appliance in the IoT system, whose predictive performance greatly depends on the selection of its hyperparameters. The major challenge of hyperparameter tuning for unsupervised machine learning models including LOF in the context of IoT systems is that the incoming data may contain new types of anomaly that are unseen in the training data.

The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity.

New applications demand the ability to cope with dynamic environments like data streams with transient behavior. Such environments present new requirements like incrementally process incoming data instances in a single pass, under both memory and time constraints. Furthermore, prediction models often need to adapt to concept drifts observed in non-stationary data streams. Ensemble learning comprises a class of stream mining algorithms that achieved remarkable prediction performance in this scenario. Implemented as a set of (several) individual component classifiers whose predictions are combined to predict new incoming instances, ensembles are naturally amendable for task parallelism. Despite its relevance, an efficient implementation of ensemble algorithms is still challenging. For example, dynamic data structures used to model non-stationary data behavior and detect concept drifts cause inefficient memory usage patterns and poor cache memory performance in multi-core environments. In this paper, we propose a minibatching strategy which can significantly reduce cache misses and improve the performance of several ensemble algorithms for stream mining in multi-core environments. We assess our strategy on four different state-of-art ensemble algorithms applying four widely used machine learning benchmark datasets with varied characteristics. Results from two different hardware show speedups of up to 5X on 8-core processors with ensembles of 100 and 150 learners. The benefits come at the cost of changes in predictive performances.","","978-1-7281-7649-9","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS50907.2020.00018","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9407935","Multicore task-parallelism;data-stream learning;ensemble learners;bagging algorithms","Adaptation models;Machine learning algorithms;Multicore processing;Heuristic algorithms;Memory management;Parallel processing;Prediction algorithms","cache storage;data mining;data structures;learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems;pattern classification","improving parallel performance;ensemble learners;data locality;mini-batching;Machine Learning techniques;virtually all domains;dynamic environments;transient behavior;incrementally process;data instances;time constraints;prediction models;concept drifts;nonstationary data streams;ensemble learning;stream mining algorithms;remarkable prediction performance;individual component classifiers whose predictions;incoming instances;task parallelism;dynamic data structures;nonstationary data behavior;inefficient memory usage patterns;poor cache memory performance;multicore environments;state-of-art ensemble algorithms;widely used machine;predictive performances","","3","","30","IEEE","26 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To describe the regional traffic conditions and capture their spatio-temporal dependencies, we present a deep learning based model - DeepRTP. Specifically, we use a novel metric called Traffic State Index (TSI) to measure regional traffic conditions, and carefully classify traffic data into three categories that are used to capture hourly, daily, and weekly traffic patterns.

To alleviate this problem, it is important for merchants to identify who can be converted into repeated buyers. By targeting on these potential loyal customers, merchants can greatly reduce the promotion cost and enhance the return on investment. According to the idea of ensemble learning in machine learning, this paper proposes a two-layer model fusion algorithm(TMFBG) based on GBDT to predict repeat buyers.

The smart physical data sources contribute to developing the level of safety and security of citizens' daily life through different smart solutions such as optimization for autonomous power grids and human health applications. Those physical devices generate a massive amount of data that is necessary for analytic applications to be applied in user services. Cloud computing technologies utilize as a centralized ICT architecture to collect the massive amount of data from all scale of the city and build the citizens' services by developers. However, several challenges in cybercrime and cybersecurity exist in Cloud computing technologies as well as large scale IoT environments and smart cities. Those challenges are i) the new generation of the attack on an IoT network is to create a problem with the availability of IoT data for the Cloud applications by overwhelming devices with information requests; ii) complex communication and computation resource constraints has a big concern to moving forward to detect attack at the edge of networks. Therefore, heading off the threat of cybercrime in large scale IoT and smart cities calls for a new study on designing cybersecurity models for ICT architecture. In this paper, we first present our fully hierarchal Distributed-to-Centralized ICT (D2C-ICT) architecture for the Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZEN) center in the context of the smart cities. Second, we propose two different novel anomaly detection models by using the contribution of Fog to cloudlet and Cloud technologies through our presented D2C-ICT Architecture in the context of the smart city.

Data will have to be collected and processed in order to extract knowledge out of it, to feed users' and smart city applications. A typical approach to process such big amounts of data is to i) gather all the collected data on the cloud through wireless pervasive networks, and ii) perform data analysis operations exploiting machine learning techniques. However, according to many studies, this centralised cloud-based approach may not be sustainable from a networking point of view. The joint effect of data-intensive users' multimedia applications and smart cities monitoring and control applications may result in severe network congestions making applications hardly usable. To cope with this problem, in this paper we propose a distributed machine learning approach that does not require to move data in a centralised cloud platform, but processes it directly where it is collected. Specifically, we exploit Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL) to build a distributed machine learning framework. In our framework we train a series of partial models, each ''residing'' in a location where a subset of the dataset is generated. We then refine the partial models by exchanging them between locations, thus obtaining a unique complete model. Using an activity classification task on a reference dataset as a concrete example, we show that the classification accuracy of the HTL model is comparable with that of a model built out of the complete dataset, but the cost in term of network overhead is dramatically reduced. We then perform a sensitiveness analysis to characterise how the overhead depends on key parameters. It is also worth noticing that the HTL approach is suitable for applications dealing with privacy sensitive data, as data can stay where they are generated, and do not need to be transferred to third parties, i.e., to a cloud provider, to extract knowledge out of it.","","978-1-5090-0898-8","10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2016.7501696","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501696","","Training;Data mining;Smart cities;Data models;Support vector machines;Cloud computing;Mobile communication","cloud computing;data analysis;data privacy;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;multimedia computing;pattern classification;smart phones","hypothesis transfer learning;HTL;data computing;smart city;mobile computing;smart phone;knowledge extraction;wireless pervasive network;data analysis;multimedia application;distributed machine learning;activity classification task;data privacy;cloud provider","","16","","20","IEEE","30 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a latent factor model based traffic signal timing plan recommendation method to address this problem. In the proposed method, we model the abstract traffic states as the “users” in recommendation systems, and timing plans as the “items”. And there are many explicit or implicit factors in the interactions between “users” and “items”. The latent factor model is successfully used to deal with uncertain factors which cannot be modeled accurately in math. The novel method adopted the model-free adaptive idea to solve the problem of modeling from the perspective of data mining and machine learning framework. And, the proposed method is tested by using simulation data generated by a microscopic traffic simulator called Paramics. The results are compared to the baseline Webster method.

Conventional port-based and deep packet inspection (DPI) approaches can't classify encrypted traffic effectively. Recent studies show that the approaches based on machine learning especially deep learning are effective for the task. However, these studies ignore the feature attributes of traffic like the location of fixed strings and change the effective features behind the traffic. In this paper, we propose a novel session-packets-based encrypted network traffic classification model using capsule neural networks (CapsNet), called SPCaps. The SPCaps introduces a twice-segmentation mechanism to dilute the interference traffic and increase the weight of effective traffic.

Monitoring the QoE (Quality of Experience) of video can help them to improve their service. However, most of the video traffic is encrypted traffic which has unreadable payload and less information in the transport layer that makes monitoring QoE a challenging task. QoE is measured from multiple metrics and many methods have been proposed to infer it. Traditional machine learning based methods have two main shortcomings. 1) These methods ignore the relevance of these metrics which can do a favor to the inference of QoE. 2) They need to extract the transport layer features and statistic features manually. In this paper, we propose multi-task learning with hierarchy (MTLH) model for inferring video QoE metrics. We use shared layer to extract deep features automatically from traffic tendency pictures which reveal the variation tendency of video streaming, that characterizes video QoE. In addition, we utilize the hierarchy to promote fine-grained start-up delay tasks. Finally, we use multitask learning architecture to learn the correlation between each task and use their correlation to refer QoE metrics. We evaluate our model for YouTube adaptive video streams on two datasets.

The communications take place mainly between cluster of worker nodes for training data and parameter servers for maintaining a global trained model. For fast convergence the worker nodes and parameter servers have to frequently exchange billions of parameters to quickly broadcast updates and minimize staleness. Demand on the bandwidth becomes even higher with the introduction of dedicated GPUs in the computation. While RDMA-capable network has a great potential to provide sufficiently high bandwidth, its current use over TCP/IP or tied to particular programming models, such as MPI, limits its capability to break the bandwidth bottleneck. In this work we propose iRDMA, an RDMA-based parameter server architecture optimized for high-performance network environment supporting both GPU- and CPU-based training. It utilizes native asynchronous RDMA verbs to achieve network line speed while minimizing the communication processing cost on both worker and parameter-server sides. Furthermore, iRDMA exposes the parameter server system as a POSIX-compatible file API for convenient support of load balance and fault tolerance as well as its easy use. We have implemented iRDMA at IBM's deep learning platform. Experiment results show that our design can help deep learning applications, including image recognition and language classification, to achieve near-linear improvement on convergence speed and training accuracy acceleration by using distributed computing resources. From the system perspective, iRDMA can efficiently utilize about 95% network bandwidth of fast networks to synchronize models among distributed training processes.","","978-1-5386-2588-0","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2017.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8291933","RDMA; deep learning; network","Servers;Training;Machine learning;Graphics processing units;Bandwidth;Computational modeling;Data models","distributed processing;learning (artificial intelligence);storage management","communication bandwidth;model training;user-time constraint;parameter servers;global trained model;RDMA-capable network;bandwidth bottleneck;parameter server architecture;high-performance network environment;network line speed;communication processing cost;parameter-server sides;parameter server system;deep learning applications;convergence speed;distributed training processes;GPUs;programming models;network bandwidth;distributed deep learning systems;asynchronous RDMA verbs;IBM;Remote Direct Memory Access","","8","","24","IEEE","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most MADRL cases, agents are trained only to deal with specific tasks, so once there are unpredictable changes in target tasks, the earlier trained-models might no longer work, and agents have to get trained again from scratch in limited time, which means traditional MADRL is unsuited to unpredictable post-disaster environments. In order to promote the scalability and flexibility of the multi-agent system, meta-learning, which has achieved few shot learning successfully in supervised deep learning field, could reuse the earlier models as the prior knowledge to guide and speed up the new task learning process. In this work, we propose a framework to apply meta learning methods to multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), and achieve efficient adaption to new tasks with less time and fewer samples. Some common experiences in the previous tasks learning will be refined as the meta knowledge. Once the tasks get changed with new scenarios, agents will get retrained with good initial network parameters based on this meta knowledge. Although the new scenarios might be different from the previous scenarios, agents could quickly adjust their policy and get better performance within only few episodes. In two experiments, our method performs better learning efficiency than others, getting higher rewards in the first several episodes of new tasks learning.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060109","meta learning;multi-agent deep reinforcement learning;few-shot learning","Task analysis;Training;Machine learning;Learning systems;Learning (artificial intelligence);Robots;Adaptation models","control engineering computing;disasters;emergency management;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;rescue robots","task learning process;earlier models;supervised deep learning field;meta-learning;multiagent system;unpredictable post-disaster environments;traditional MADRL;trained-models;target tasks;unpredictable changes;MADRL cases;robotic applications;disaster rescue;multiagent deep reinforcement learning;meta learning;fast adaptation;learning efficiency;meta knowledge;multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient;learning methods","","2","","14","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, the IoT became an emerging technology. One of the most significant current research discussion topics on the IoT is about the smart car parking. A modern urban city has over a million of cars on its roads but it does not have enough parking space. Moreover, most of the contemporary researchers propose management of the data on cloud. However, this method may be considered as an issue since the raw data is sent promptly from distributed sensors to the parking area via cloud and then received back after it is processed. This is considered as an expensive technique in terms of the data transmission as well as the energy cost and consumption. While the majority of proposed solutions address the problem of finding unoccupied parking space and ignore some other critical issues such as information about the nearest car parking and the roads traffic congestion, this paper goes beyond and proposes the alternative method. The paper proposes a smart car parking system that will assist users to solve the issue of finding a parking space and to minimise the time spent in searching for the nearest available car park. In addition, it provides users with roads traffic congestion status. Moreover, the proposed system collects the raw data locally and extracts features by applying data filtering and fusion techniques to reduce the transmitted data over the network. After that, the transformed data is sent to the cloud for processing and evaluating by using machine learning algorithms.","","978-1-5386-4427-0","10.1109/CAIS.2018.8442004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8442004","Internet of Things (IoT);smart city;smart car parking;Disruptive Car Parks;embedded computing;Cloud data mining;Fog Computing;Distributed Data Analytics;","Automobiles;Cloud computing;Intelligent sensors;Sensor systems;Real-time systems;Roads","distributed sensors;feature extraction;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);road traffic;smart cities;traffic engineering computing","smart car parking system solution;smart cities;IoT;emerging technology;parking area;data transmission;energy cost;unoccupied parking space;roads traffic congestion status;data filtering;fusion techniques;transmitted data;transformed data;urban city;energy consumption;Internet of Things;distributed sensors;machine learning algorithms","","30","","25","IEEE","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since cars are not uniformly distributed across city areas, monitoring the number of cars available within restricted urban areas is crucial for both shaping service provision and improving the user experience. To address these issues, the application of machine learning techniques to analyze car mobility data has become more and more appealing. This paper focuses on forecasting the number of cars available in a restricted urban area in the short term (e.g., in the next 2 hours). It applies regression techniques to train multivariate models from heterogeneous data including the occupancy levels of the target and neighbor areas, weather and temporal information (e.g., season, holidays, daily time slots). To contextualize occupancy level predictions according to the target time and location, we generate models tailored to specific profiles of areas according to the prevalent category of Points-of-Interest in the area. Furthermore, to avoid bias due to presence of uncorrelated features we perform feature selection prior to regression model learning. As a case study, the prediction system is applied to data acquired from a real car sharing system.

In recent years, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have received more and more attention in power load prediction because traditional machine learning models cannot capture the time dependencies that often exist in power load data. However, due to the self-connection of the hidden layer, the vanishing gradient problem is very easy to occur with the increasing depth of the simple RNN, which leads to the decline of the prediction accuracy. In order to solve this problem, this paper adopts the recently developed RNN architecture called Clock-Work RNN (CW-RNN) on the task of one day ahead prediction. The research focuses on the construction strategy of recurrent connection matrix related to the hidden layer in CW-RNN. An improved CW-RNN named CW-RNN-SCR adopts the strategy of connecting adjacent modules into a simply closed ring, which not only improves the prediction accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters required for training. Experimental results show that the improved CW-RNN can achieve better performance than the traditional RNN architectures.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00140","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060388","power load prediction, CW-RNN, SRNN, LSTM, GRU","Logic gates;Computer architecture;Neurons;Time series analysis;Microprocessors;Recurrent neural networks;Load modeling","learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;power engineering computing;recurrent neural nets;smart power grids","construction strategy;improved clock-work RNN architecture;vanishing gradient problem;self-connection;environmentally friendly power services;CW-RNN-SCR;recurrent connection matrix;day ahead prediction;prediction accuracy;power load data;machine learning models;recurrent neural networks;power grid;smart grid;power load prediction","","1","","16","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We make a thorough study of the performance in terms of computation speedup and power consumption on two smart phone platforms. Our results demonstrate that, compared with original implementation, the increase of computation speed ranges from 2 to 18 by using RenderScript while the power consumption overhead is capped by 75%. By adopting heterogeneous computing, the total energy required for executing the applications can be significantly reduced. Based on the benchmarking results, the potential for improving energy efficiency of multi-core mobile devices is discussed.","","978-1-4673-7392-0","10.1109/SECONW.2015.7328142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328142","smart city;mobile heterogeneous computing;RenderScript;energy efficiency","Benchmark testing;Mobile communication;Power demand;Smart phones;Image edge detection","Android (operating system);image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);linear algebra;mobile computing;multiprocessing systems;smart phones;system-on-chip;telecommunication power management","energy efficient multicore mobile devices;multicore system on chips;SoC;smart phones;tablets;multicore desktops;mobile heterogeneous computing;Android system;linear algebra;machine learning;image processing;RenderScript heterogeneous version","","","","21","IEEE","16 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the sparse matrix representation has a significant impact on the resulting application performance, choosing the right representation typically relies on expert knowledge and trial and error. This paper provides the first comprehensive study on the impact of sparse matrix representations on two emerging many-core architectures: the Intel's Knights Landing (KNL) XeonPhi and the ARM-based FT-2000Plus (FTP). Our large-scale experiments involved over 9,500 distinct profiling runs performed on 956 sparse datasets and five mainstream SpMV representations. We show that the best sparse matrix representation depends on the underlying architecture and the program input. To help developers to choose the optimal matrix representation, we employ machine learning to develop a predictive model. Our model is first trained offline using a set of training examples. The learned model can be used to predict the best matrix representation for any unseen input for a given architecture. We show that our model delivers on average 95% and 91% of the best available performance on KNL and FTP respectively, and it achieves this with no runtime profiling overhead.","","978-1-5386-6614-2","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622854","Sparse matrix vector multiplication, Performance optimization, Many-Cores, Performance analysis","Sparse matrices;Random access memory;Two dimensional displays;Predictive models;Arrays","learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;matrix multiplication;sparse matrices;storage management;vectors","sparse matrix-vector multiplication;sparse matrix vector multiplication;high-performance applications;application performance bottleneck;sparse matrix representation;mainstream SpMV representations;optimal matrix representation;many-core architectures;sparse datasets;ARM-based FT-2000Plus","","16","","52","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of these services concerns activity recognition within Ambient Assisted Living which can be used to help people live independently at home for longer. Many of these applications can, however, be prone to failure and vulnerable to attack. Extensive research is therefore required to build towards a secure and sustainable IoT. This work examines activity recognition in a smart home environment using three different classifiers on a well-known activity recognition dataset. Fail-dirty and device shut-down data is introduced in the dataset to examine the impact that this erroneous data has on the application. This study found that it was possible to rank the importance of sensors with regards to their influence on classification by observing how these failures impacted the classifiers when compared to the fmeasure produced from the classification of the clean data. This work also found that while representing data in a binary format obtains higher accuracy, it makes the classifier considerably more vulnerable to dirty data. Lastly, this study found that decision tree classifiers have an inherent vulnerability when it comes to handling dirty data, resulting in a 24% reduction in performance versus the clean data, due to the structuring and placement of leaf nodes in the tree.","","978-1-7281-4034-6","10.1109/SmartWorld-UIC-ATC-SCALCOM-IOP-SCI.2019.00335","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9060225","iot;activity recognition;internet;things;smart home;reliability;classification;machine learning;fail-dirty","Activity recognition;Reliability;Intelligent sensors;Batteries;Silicon;Internet of Things","assisted living;computer network reliability;computer network security;decision trees;failure analysis;Internet of Things;pattern classification;sensors","device failure;data representation;device shut-down data;attack vulnerability;Internet of Things;erroneous data impact analysis;IoT reliability;impact analysis;decision tree classifiers;dirty data;clean data;fail-dirty device;activity recognition dataset;smart home environment;sustainable IoT;secure IoT;ambient assisted living","","1","","19","IEEE","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brands want their customers to be in pleasing subliminal scented2 environments because, as research has shown, even a few micro-particles of scent can do a lot of marketing's heavy lifting, from improving consumer perceptions of quality to increasing the number of store visits. Hence, customer venues such as hotels, retail showrooms, casinos, hospitable and other captive audience places employ HVAC (Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) based scent diffusion system that delivers a seamless olfactory [2] experience to connect with consumers on a deeper emotional level, resulting in a more memorable experience. Current state of the art of HVAC dispenser systems, however, uses power hungry deployments [3] to monitor and dispense periodically, without accounting venue-patron occupancy ratios and sudden changes in foot traffic numbers. Thus, resulting sub-optimal user experience that might lead to a poor brand engagement and could incur higher operational costs [5] and thus reduce over all return on the investment (ROI). In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to implement intelligent HVAC dispensing that improve venue experience and operational efficiencies through the application of Big Data Technologies, Edge processing and IoT Sensing. Our system combines a lightweight edge anomaly detection algorithm based on Kalman filter and venue ambient condition to foot traffic graph matrix. The amalgamation of anomaly detection using Kalman filter to the venue ambiance with the application of machine learning creates an adaptive edge and that is our formula to the innovation that we propose and present a prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.","","978-1-5386-0435-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2017.8397583","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397583","Adaptive Edge;Internet of things;Machine Learning;Scent Marketing;HVAC;Venue Analytics;Complex Event Processing;Decision Tree;Regression Analysis;Free RTOS;Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency","Decision trees;Kalman filters;Covariance matrices;Wireless fidelity;DC motors;Noise measurement;Image edge detection","Big Data;consumer behaviour;customer satisfaction;HVAC;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);smart cities","suboptimal user experience;heating-ventilation-and-air conditioning based scent diffusion system;edge processing;brand engagement;brand loyalty;smart cities;venue ambient condition;lightweight edge anomaly detection algorithm;venue experience;intelligent HVAC dispensing;foot traffic numbers;HVAC dispenser systems;air conditioning;hospitable audience places;customer venues;emotional connections;venue brand engagement;adaptive edge analytics","","5","","17","IEEE","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) are implemented on traffic data to develop a model to distinguish accident cases from normal cases. The performance of RF algorithm, in terms of its accuracy, was found superior to ANN and SVM algorithms. RF algorithm has showed better performance with 91.56% accuracy than SVM with 88.71% and ANN with 90.02% accuracy.","","978-1-5386-4817-9","10.1109/LT.2018.8368509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8368509","Internet of Things (IoT);vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs);Accident Detection;Machine Learning;Artificial Neural Networks (ANN);Random Forests;Support Vector Machines (SVM);Traffic Simulation","Accidents;Support vector machines;Artificial neural networks;Probes;Roads;Sensors;Vehicular ad hoc networks","intelligent transportation systems;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);road accidents;road safety;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;vehicular ad hoc networks","road traffic accidents;intelligent traffic accident detection system;microscopic vehicle variables;vehicular ad-hoc networks;traffic alerts;machine learning methods;supervised machine learning algorithms;random forest classifier;IoT;Intelligent Transportation Systems;traffic accident detection;VANETs","","123","","29","IEEE","31 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning has been successfully introduced into SpMT to improve its performance. An appropriate sample set is important for machine learning-based (ML-based) thread partition. Conventionally, heuristic rules-based (HR-based) sample generation approach can not generate adaptive samples, which conform to ML-based thread partition platform and characteristics of source applications. A hybrid sample generation approach is proposed. With this method, we firstly automatically generate samples which are mips codes consisting spawning points (SP) and control quasi-independent points (CQIP) by heuristic rules, then manually adjust the positions of SP and CQIP and rebuild pre-computation slice (p-slice) to obtain better performance for every application. During the implementation of this approach, three measures: bias weighting, reservation of optimal solutions, summary of greedy rules are carried out. In this way, we enhance the adjustment frequency for the subroutine with high called number, achieving a stable improvement of speedups. On Prophet, which is a generic SpMT processor to evaluate the performance of multithreaded programs, Olden benchmarks are used to realize the approach. Experiments show that the approach can obtain better sample sets, which deliver a better performance improvement of about 10% on a 32 core than conventional heuristic-based approach. Experiments also prove that this approach is effective to get sample sets for ML-based thread partition methods.","","978-1-5090-4297-5","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828357","Speculative Multithreading;sample generation;manual adjustment","Instruction sets;Manuals;Algorithms;Multithreading;Hybrid power systems;Conferences;Benchmark testing","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-threading;parallel processing;parallelising compilers","hybrid sample generation;speculative multithreading;thread level automatic parallelization technique;sequential program acceleration;machine learning-based thread partition;ML-based thread partition;heuristic rules-based sample generation;HR-based sample generation;mips codes;spawning points;control quasi-independent points;CQIP;pre-computation slice;p-slice;bias weighting;optimal solution reservation;greedy rules;Prophet;generic SpMT processor;Olden benchmarks;automatic program parallelization;parallelizing compiler technology","","3","","22","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the challenges that machine learning currently faces is how to handle incremental data, especially in the case where the previous round of data has the same part of data with the current round of data. The shortcomings of existing big industrial data regression prediction models are: (1) there is a large amount of redundancy between batch data; (2) for some iterations, not every element in the working set generated by a single iteration needs to re-participate in the next iteration; In this paper, we introduce a machine learning regression algorithm based on incremental iteration. The overall goal is to reduce memory usage and optimise the computational efficiency of curve fitting in order to achieve high performance when the algorithm occurs on a large data set. The experimental results show that: (1) provides a faster regression prediction algorithm, which significantly improves the calculation efficiency and its cost; (2) provides a method of storage, which saves storage space; The proposed concepts and algorithms combine typical industrial application scenarios with advanced artificial intelligence and have the potential to accelerate the implementation of Industry 4.0.","","978-1-7281-2058-4","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2019.00260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855568","Big industrial data, Computational efficiency, Incremental iteration, Industry 4.0, Regression prediction,","Handheld computers;Conferences;High performance computing;Smart cities;Data science","Big Data;curve fitting;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;regression analysis","incremental iteration;computational efficiency;machine learning;data storage space;regression prediction algorithm;big industrial data;curve fitting;artificial intelligence;Industry 4.0","","","","27","IEEE","3 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Decision tree is an efficient machine learning approach that can use data only without the involvement of decision maker to improve the decision making process. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)is another paradigm used for data classification. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy classification method based on MCDA called PROAFTN. To use PROAFTN, a set of parameters need to be established from data. The proposed approach uses data pre-processing and canonical genetic algorithm (GA) for obtaining these parameters from data. The generated models have been applied on popular data selected from several application domain, health, economy, etc. According to our experimental study, the new model performs significantly better than decision trees according in terms of accuracy and the interpretation of the decision rules.","","978-1-4673-9584-7","10.1109/ICBDSC.2016.7460369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460369","PROAFTN;Decision Tree;MCDA","Prototypes;Decision trees;Data models;Training;Entropy;Big data;Smart cities","decision trees;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","meta-heuristic approach;PROAFTN;decision tree;machine learning algorithms;decision making process;multicriteria decision analysis;MCDA;data classification;fuzzy classification method;canonical genetic algorithm;GA;decision rules","","","","22","IEEE","28 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, as a data reduction technique, SVD is widely used for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It also has extensive applications in the machine learning domain. For example, it is widely used in feature selection, data clustering, classification, and regression. Traditional sequential SVD algorithms take cubic time which may not be affordable especially when the input matrix is large. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop efficient sequential and parallel SVD algorithms. Jacobi iteration, as one of the most common SVD algorithms, has attracted a lot of attention. Among many algorithms that have been proposed, there are some relaxation schemes that have been proven to be very effective in parallel Jacobi-SVD computing. Such relaxation schemes are platform and architecture independent. In this paper, we propose some novel techniques to further generalize and speedup these relaxation schemes. Theoretical analysis proves the efficiency of our algorithms. Experimental results also show that our algorithms outperform the existing ones.","","978-1-5386-6614-2","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622794","Singular Value Decomposition;Parallel Algorithms;Relaxation Schemes","Jacobian matrices;Signal processing algorithms;Program processors;Principal component analysis;Parallel processing;Symmetric matrices;Clustering algorithms","iterative methods;Jacobian matrices;linear algebra;parallel algorithms;singular value decomposition","sequential SVD algorithms;parallel singular value decomposition;matrix factorization;linear algebra;parallel Jacobi-SVD computing;relaxation schemes;Jacobi iteration;machine learning domain","","1","","27","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To command this piece of hardware (start and stop recording, as well as annotate raw data), a mobile application was specifically developed. A total of 70 well-known features both from time and frequency domains that are mostly used in activity recognition were computed over each signal to produce enough discriminating characteristics. Then, two machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors) were employed to classify such data. The proposed method was tested with 9 participants on four soil types with an experimental setup close to real use case situations. Results obtained let us state that a soil-types recognition is not only possible but also accurate and reliable since overall median F-Score measures of 82% and 86% were obtained respectively with the Random Forest and the k-NN classifiers.

Although data-parallel ML systems often engage a perfect error tolerance when synchronizing the model parameters for maximizing parallelism, the synchronization of model parameters may delay in completion, a problem that generally gets worse at a large scale. This paper presents a Bounded Asynchronous Parallel (BAP) model of computation that allows computations using stale model parameters in order to reduce synchronization overheads. In the meanwhile, our BAP model ensures theoretical convergence guarantees for large scale data-parallel ML applications. This model permits distributed workers to use the stale parameters storing in the local cache, instead of waiting until the Parameter Server (PS) produces a new version. This expressively reduces the time workers spend on waiting. Furthermore, the BAP model guarantees the convergence of ML algorithm by bounding the maximum distance of the stale parameters. Experiments conducted on 4 cluster nodes with up to 32 GPUs showed that our model significantly improved the proportion of computing time relative to the waiting time and led to 1.2-2×speedup. Besides, we elaborated how to choose the staleness threshold when considering the tradeoff between Efficiency and Speed.","","978-1-5090-4297-5","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2016.0110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828451","distributed systems;Bounded Asynchronous Parallel;Bulk Synchronous Parallel;Total Asynchronous Parallel;stale parameters;tradeoff","Computational modeling;Synchronization;Convergence;Data models;Servers;Parallel processing;Conferences","fault tolerant computing;learning (artificial intelligence);synchronisation","synchronization scheme;stale parameters;machine learning;training dataset;data-parallel ML systems;error tolerance;bounded asynchronous parallel model;BAP;theoretical convergence guarantees;parameter server;PS;BAP model;ML algorithm;cluster nodes;staleness threshold","","1","","21","IEEE","26 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Both of the users' delay-tolerance and energy consumption are considered in our QoE evaluation.

To solve this issue, we propose a lightweight differential privacy-preserving mechanism for the edge computing environment. We extend ε-differential privacy theory to a mature machine learning localization technology to achieve privacy protection while training the localization model. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that, compared with the original localization technology without privacy-preserving, our proposed scheme can achieve high accuracy of indoor localization while providing differential privacy guarantee. Through regulating the value of ε, the data quality loss of our method can be controlled up to 8.9% and the time consumption can be almost negligible.

Emerging and disruptive technologies such as Artificial Intelligence are transforming the way we uncover and bring value, making them optimal when it comes to building and maintaining a smart city. Artificial Intelligence has become a driving force behind many technological innovations and proved significant in different fields including medicine, education, marketing, food technology, banking, and green technology. Nowadays, people are more aware of pressing matters concerning the environment. They are more willing to opt for environmentally friendly solutions wherever possible. We aim to introduce a solution by which people's actions to limit environmental damage are not limited to merely purchasing ecofriendly products but extended to getting those products delivered in a way that is least harmful to the planet. Therefore, this paper proposes a CO2 emission predictive analysis using Artificial Intelligence that calculates and predicts the amounts of CO2 to be emitted from a cargo van in advance. The system takes into account the total distance to be traveled and the amount of gas needed to travel that distance and predict the emission accordingly. This paper proposes that such a system should also be embedded with self-driving cars, as in the smart cities of the future self-driving cars will become the norm. Relevant conceptual information used to develop the predictive analysis system is discussed. A discussion is also made on the development of the system as well as the preparation of the dataset. The system is analyzed based on the accuracy of the prediction.

Most existing unattended parking lots suffer from a lack of seamless automation, instead deploying ticketing and payment at ingress and egress points or other systems with heavy user involvement that often form bottlenecks. Similarly, many lots use per-space sensing with expensive networking and power requirements simply to determine space occupancy. Parking solutions that are free from the delay caused by this user burden and infrastructure could experience faster occupancy turnover with lower cost. An ongoing challenge in developing seamless parking experiences is the detection and identification of vehicles in parking spaces without the need for complex and expensive per-space occupancy detection technology. We develop a smart parking solution that uses a single low-power wireless radio technology to seamlessly perform parked vehicle localization and transport of sensor data for use by a central management system. Our solution uses a sparse, self-forming network of dual-mode Bluetooth sensors within a parking area to observe the presence of customized authenticated Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacons placed in vehicles parked in the lot. Our localization technique is based on radio fingerprinting using Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values from the beacon, and a random forest machine learning classifier that predicts where the vehicle is parked based on its fingerprint. We implemented our solution in Python on commodity Internet of Things (IoT) hardware and deployed it to a 105 space outdoor parking lot. There, we conducted fingerprinting and prediction experiments. Our results show that our exact-space prediction model evaluates with a high accuracy using radio training data (90.7% correctly identified), and our in-vehicle tests show a promising result (69.17% accurate up to and including 3 spaces away), even without employing tuning and data filtering techniques. This encouraging result shows that localization using Bluetooth is a viable means of managing parked vehicles, with great promise for a variety of future parking management applications.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-1217-6","10.1109/VTCSpring.2019.8746459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8746459","","Bluetooth;Feature extraction;Space vehicles;Cryptography;Authentication;Mesh networks;Advertising","Bluetooth;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);traffic control;traffic engineering computing;wireless sensor networks","secure outdoor smart parking;dual mode bluetooth mesh networks;smart city initiatives;seamless automation;per-space sensing;expensive networking;power requirements;faster occupancy turnover;seamless parking experiences;complex space occupancy detection technology;smart parking solution;radio technology;parked vehicle localization;sensor data;central management system;sparse self-forming network;radio fingerprinting;random forest machine learning classifier;exact-space prediction model;radio training data;in-vehicle tests;parked vehicles;received signal strength indication;parking management;space outdoor parking lot;parking lot automation;unattended parking lots;low-power wireless radio technology;dual-mode Bluetooth sensors;customized authenticated Bluetooth low-energy beacons;Python;commodity Internet of Things","","12","","27","IEEE","27 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has a wide range of applications in machine learning, data mining and other fields. With the emergence of big data age, the training process of random forest becomes very lengthy. Most studies speed up the training of random forests through small clusters or high performance device, however, few pay attention to high performance supercomputers. In this paper, we propose a parallel random forest training framework on supercomputers called DistForest which can utilize multiple nodes to train random forest with large data sets concurrently. Firstly, DistForest applies master-slave architecture in which system will select some nodes as the primary node to distribute the large tasks to other slave nodes. Secondly, DistForest exploits a multilevel parallel strategy which pushes small tasks to a task queue rather than continues to distribute them among other slaves. Thirdly, DistForest can use the heterogeneous architecture of supercomputers to accelerated training process. Finally, DistForest can also balance computing tasks between devices with different computing ability. Our performance results on Tianhe-2 show our implementation can acquire very high performance improvement.","","978-1-5386-6614-2","10.1109/HPCC/SmartCity/DSS.2018.00057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622795","Parallel Random Forest;Supercomputers;Speed up;Framework","Training;Supercomputers;Task analysis;Decision trees;Vegetation;Radio frequency;Forestry","Big Data;decision trees;mainframes;parallel algorithms;parallel machines;pattern classification;random forests","DistForest;supercomputer;parallel random forest training framework;random forest algorithm;ensemble classifier algorithm;high performance device;high performance supercomputers;big data;decision tree model;master-slave architecture","","","","26","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
