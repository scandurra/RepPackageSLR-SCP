The proposed system is evaluated on a use case that estimates the best possible locations of a restaurant according to main characteristics taken as inputs from entrepreneurs via a Web based application. These characteristics are Meal Price per customer, HouseHold Type, Gender, and Age. The first phase of decision process is estimating mentioned features such as House Price per district and local population belonging to different HouseHold type, Gender, and Age with less error rates for the consecutive years.

From the smart city perspective, the main goal is to make well-informed decisions, on the base of a variable number of sensors and sources, exposing different data with different protocols and structures. The urban contexts may change, and with them, the number of sensors deployed. The novel smart city service must go beyond an integration strategy, it needs an exploitation model to optimally retrieve useful and highly contextualized information. In this paper we focus on the development of a model which fuses together the IoE potential and machine learning techniques for the cognitive smart city: retrive useful intelligent information, optimally exploiting the infrastructure the specific physical context may offer. We propose an approach and related techniques for realizing context agnostic services, namely services that do not depend on the enabling infrastructure beneath. The purpose is to create an IoE-based self-contextualizing service, which potentially consider the entire range of data that is being collected in smart cities and use such data to provide highly-personalized information about each environment, i.e., information that best suits the context of each Smart City. To prove the proposed context agnostic service, we take into account the air quality observation issue: we provide two high-contextualized informative services to leverage data related to two different physical environments, thus building location awareness for different geographic areas and stakeholders.

In edge computing, data collected by IoT devices are processed on edge servers rather than being transported to cloud server. Compared with cloud computing, edge computing could avoid the possibility of pedestrians' privacy being leaked from cloud server or being stolen in the process of transmission. However, edge servers are not always safe. For instance, there are researches show that 89% of WiFi hotspots are unsecured. Hence, it is possible for attackers to know where you go at a given time of the day, which places you prefer to visit from images collected by IoT devices, such as camera, UAVs. Considering the data collected by IoT devices could include the sensitive information about users, we propose a scheme that applies differential privacy to protect the collected data.

One of the smart city solutions is to establish an efficient fleet management relating to the use of a fleet of vehicles (e.g., ambulances and police vehicles). The most basic function in a fleet management system is the real time vehicle tracking component. This component is usually the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) or the integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). To predict the position, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is generally applied using the sensor's measures and the GPS position as a helper. However, the DGPS high cost solution still suffers from GPS satellite signals loss due to multipath errors and the INS require more complex computing. Furthermore, the EKF performance depends on the vehicle dynamic variations and may quickly diverge because of environment changes (i.e, GPS failures by obstructions from building and trees). In this paper, we present a robust low cost approach using EKF and neural networks (NN) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reliably estimate the real time vehicle position using GPS enhanced with low cost Dead Reckoning (DR) sensors. While GPS signals are available, we train the NN with GA on different dynamics and outage times to learn the position errors so we can correct the future EKF predictions during GPS signal outages. We obtain empirically an improvement of up to 95% over the simple EKF predictions in case of GPS failures.",,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7804998,data fusion;Extended Kalman Filter;Global Positioning System;intelligent transportation systems;smart cities;Dead Reckoning;low cost;neural networks;Genetic Algorithm,Global Positioning System;Vehicles;Artificial neural networks;Genetic algorithms;Sensors;Kalman filters;Vehicle dynamics,genetic algorithms;Global Positioning System;intelligent transportation systems;Kalman filters;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;nonlinear filters;smart cities,GPS failures;GPS signal outages;EKF predictions;position errors;NN training;low cost dead reckoning sensors;genetic algorithm;EKF;neural networks;GPS position;global positioning system;vehicle tracking component;fleet management;urban population growth;information and communication technologies;evolutionary machine learning;extended Kalman filter;smart city;real time car positioning,,,15,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,

With the queueing network model and traffic flow analysis, optimal operation of service could be achieved with minimum average travel time. The optimal number of available AVs could be identified while guaranteeing the waiting time of customers.

The traditional way to manage WSNs is not suitable for this type of applications, because manually managing and monitoring every single sensor would be too expensive, time consuming and error prone. Moreover, unattended sensors may suffer of several issues that progressively make their measures unreliable and consequently useless. For this reason, several automatically techniques have been studied and implemented for the detection and correction of measurements from sensors which are affected by errors caused by aging and/or drift. These methods are grouped under the name of self-calibration techniques. This paper presents a distributed system, which combines an incremental machine learning technique with a non-linear Kalman Filter estimator, which allows to automatically re-calibrate sensors leveraging the correlation with measurements made by neighbor sensors.

In this paper, we propose a system framework to recognize the web crawlers and take corresponding actions for handle them. The access requests of a website are recorded by the logs, and then a machine learning approach is used to distinguish the web crawlers from normal users based on the logs. Detail components and procedures of the system framework are illustrated. Based on the system framework and approach, we implement an anti-crawler system.

There are however many cases in current big data analytics applications where for same topic and even same source data sets there are differing attributes being measured, for a multitude of reasons (whether the specific design of an experiment or poor data quality and consistency). We define this class of data a dimensionally inconsistent multivariate data, a topic that can be considered a subclass of the Big Data Variety research. This paper explores some classification methodologies commonly used in multivariate classification and clustering tasks and considers how these traditional methodologies could be adapted to compare dimensionally inconsistent data sets. The study focuses on adapting two similarity measures: Robinson-Foulds tree distance metrics and Variation of Information; for comparing clustering of hierarchical cluster algorithms (such clusters are derived from the raw multivariate data). The results from experiments on engineering data highlight that adapting pairwise measures to exclude non-common attributes from the traditional distance metrics may not be the best method of classification. We suggest that more specialised metrics of similarity are required to address challenges presented by dimensionally inconsistent multivariate data, with specific applications for big engineering data analytics.",,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622989,Similarity measures;Robinson Foulds;Variation of Information;Engineering data;Multivariate numerical data;Dimensional inconsistency,Measurement;Time series analysis;Feature extraction;Phylogeny;Mutual information;Big Data;Data mining,Big Data;data analysis;data mining;pattern classification;pattern clustering;regression analysis;trees (mathematics),classification methodologies;multivariate classification;clustering tasks;raw multivariate data;engineering data highlight;big engineering data analytics;multivariate data classification;clustering methodologies;data mining;source data sets;data quality;big data analytics applications;big data variety research;Robinson-Foulds tree distance metrics;variation of information;hierarchical cluster algorithms,,,17,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,

A basic definition of rural-urban linkages is that they consist of flows (of goods, people, information, finance, waste, information, social relations) across space, linking rural and urban areas (Cecilia, 2015). Economically, rural and urban areas are linked by the reciprocal exchange of unprocessed and processed products, with both areas acting as mutually reinforcing markets [1]. Perhaps a less descriptive definition is of the functional links between sectors (agriculture, industry and services). The latter is central to structural change taking place in both rural and urban areas. Additionally, rural and urban economies exhibit symbiotic relationship. Cecilia [2] notes ""in many regions of the world we are witnessing an increase in production, especially of perishable and high-value products such as fruit, vegetables and dairy, responding to urban demand"". This is especially the case in rural areas that are well connected to urban markets by transport links, communications and electricity, and by networks of local traders (Cecilia, 2015). This is especially true with Dairy Industry. The dairy industry exhibits mini ecosystem of rural and urban linkage. The dairy industry plays an important role for both rural and urban dwellers: a) a major source of rural employment (12% to 14% of world population [6]), b) consistent non-seasonal source of income with immediate cash returns, c) major urban consumer staple and d) major contributor of agriculture GDP in developing countries. In many developing countries, dairy industry employees majority of workforce from rural and have direct influence on rural and urban commerce. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [3], ""more than 6 billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products; the majority of these people live in developing countries"" [2]. It's clear from the above, urban and rural areas have symbiotic relationship and in order to make urban areas smart, aka Smart Cities, it is imperative that the linkage of urban, in this case rural areas, needs be Smart entities, aka. Smart Villages. For making Smart Village, according to Viswanadham [7] ""the existing infrastructure and services (such as Power, Water, Buildings, Retail, Health care, etc.) need to be upgraded and in building the new ones. This requires standardization, use of IT and sensor networks"". In this research paper, we propose innovative approach to develop dairy IoT sensor network that enables Smart dairy, making Smart Villages a reality. We offer development of Smart Dairy IoT Sensors that not only identify cattle related health issues but also enable data and information sharing with dairy farmers for better predicting milk production and improvement of productivity. In addition, the data collected from IoT sensor and analytics models play pivotal role in preventing spread of viral flus and cattle health issues. Finally, the data collected from our IoT Dairy sensors and analytics will enable digital transformation at village level thus enabling cities smarter.

In order to meet these demands, NGCN is expected to deploy huge number of small cells (i.e. Femto cells, Pico cells & Micro cells) along with the current Macro LTE-A cells. Each NGCN cell is expected to consist of all the aforesaid type of cells supporting services like Device to Device (D2D) communications, Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC), Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Vehicles (IoV), etc. This in turn leads to proliferation of devices in the network supporting aforesaid heterogeneous services. On the other hand, the availability of different type of Next Generation Node B (gNBs) may vary dynamically based on event, time, location, weather conditions, load conditions etc. Therefore, it is necessary for UEs or smart devices to camp on to the appropriate gNB in order to avail un-interrupted and seamless services with high QoS and QoE. This article explores different use cases based on three dimensional axis of NGCN i.e. requirements, technologies and services, wherein the availability of gNBs vary depending on each use case. Furthermore, we explore the avenues of Access Network Discovery and Selection Function (ANDSF) node functionality to automate the congestion free network discovery and selection and help the devices to camp on to the optimal gNBs without the intervention of Mobile Network Operators (MNOs).

The Graph Rules, used by Graph Transformation, are defined to construct hidden layers in GraphLab to get more control over information flow. The ""Update Function"" and Graph Transformation trigger each other, which forms Hybrid GraphLab. The Hybrid GraphLab allows more flexible, fault tolerant, computational capabilities and possibilities to add more hidden multi-layers in tune with deep learning.

Presently there is indeed no good solution to this problem. The existing applications and devices are not much effective as they need lot of human interaction to operate. These existing devices use to read the human temperature and heartbeat to generate alarm in case of emergency. When a person runs, every human may have different body temperature and heartbeat pattern and thus keeping a fixed threshold for finding out emergency situation and then generating alarm is not correct way and this is where the existing devices are failing to correctly generate alarm in case of emergency. In this paper the devices are customized to learn the individual pattern of temperature and heartbeat and then it finds out the threshold for generating alarm. Thus this paper deals to design a wearable women safety device that automatically reads and create patterns such as body temperature and pulse rate during running. If readings are higher than the normal readings then it will automatically call and message more than one person along with the location so that actions can be taken. We have used temperature and pulse sensors that will detect the activity of the woman and that data of sensors will be sent to cloud where machine learning algorithm (logistic regression) is applied to analyse the data generated. The data is first collected by sensors in non-danger conditions to train the algorithm, after that data is used for testing to gauge the accuracy and how close it is to our trained data. More is the accuracy more is the surety of danger and the emergency alarm will be there on emergency contacts. Thirdly, this paper deals with scenarios where there is no internet facility.

There is solid evidence that the vast majority of such malicious bot traffic comes from data centers. The malicious bot deployed on the hosts of data centers is referred to as a CloudBot. How to detect and block CloudBots effectively has become an urgent problem in practice, while the research on it can be seldom seen in public. To this end, we propose a traffic-based quasi-real-time method for CloudBot detection using machine learning, which exploits a new sample partitioning approach, as well as innovative multi-layer features that reveal the essential difference between CloudBots and human traffic. Our method achieves 93.4% precision in the experiment and performs well on the real-world dataset, which proves to be effective to detect unknown CloudBots and combat the concept drift caused by varying time.

A high correlation between pollutants and weather parameters is determined by using Pearson correlation. In contrary to traditional sensor network, this work utilizes cloud-centric IoT middleware architecture that not only receives data from air pollution sensors but also from existing weather sensors. Thus provides two-fold reliability and reduce the cost substantially. The Artificial Neural Network has been used to predict the level of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Particular Matter (PM2.5).

POIs are mostly used on location based social media applications, especially for place recommendation. Social media users share the places they like and discovering such new POIs has importance for understanding the taste and preference of city citizens and for understanding the city. An important problem is, in a given social media message, detecting which word can be POI. This process of retrieving points of interest from a text is called POI extraction. In this work, we propose methods to extract POIs from microblogs. We explore both machine learning and artificial neural network based approaches. As machine learning approach, we use Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for sequential tagging. We investigate the effect of various additional features such as sentiment of tweets, POI density and population density of the location where the tweet was posted. We also use built-in features of CRF. As a hybrid approach, we generate word embeddings by Word2vec and apply K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm on the vectors constructed. Finally we construct a deep, feed-forward neural network to extract POIs from microblog text. These techniques are applied on a collection of tweets in Turkish posted by users from Ankara.

In this paper, the ways of finding citizen problems with their locations by using tweet data is discussed. Tweets in Turkish language from the Aegean Region of Turkey were used for the study. It is aimed to form a smart system, which detects problems of citizens and extracts the problems' exact locations from tweet texts. Firstly, the collected data was analyzed to get information of any city event, citizen's complaint or requests about a problem. After the possibility of detecting tweets, which have any city problem, was ensured, two datasets were created. The first one consists of the tweets that have an event information or a problem and the second one has the tweets, which have other information not related to our study. Then Naive Bayes classifier was trained on the annotated tweets and was tested on a separate set of tweets. Accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure of the classifier is given. A location recognizer, which finds the Turkish place names in a text, is created and applied on the tweets that are marked as information-containing by the classifier to detect the location of the problem precisely. The first findings of the project is promising. The high accuracy, which is obtained by the classifier, shows that it is proper to use this classifier for our study.

For example, in mapping a parallel for loop to hardware, OpenMP 4 offers commands for exploiting vector instructions (simd directives) and automatic GPU offloading (target directives), as well as schedule directives for CPU load balancing. These benefits come with a cost. A developer has to be well aware of the architecture details, and the application, and must iteratively tune to determine the best combination of pragma directives delivering higher performance for the given target architecture. Hence in this paper we introduce Rigel, a framework that automates these decisions to arrive at optimized OpenMP annotated code.

Both Vector Classification and GPU Offloading Classification models perform with average accuracies of 83%. Succeeding the classification process, code segments are optimized accordingly.

However, transaction fraud incidents also occur frequently, causing a larger number of economic losses. Therefore, transaction fraud detection is significant. The methods of machine learning are often used to detect fraudulent transactions from a larger amount of transaction data. However, the class imbalance problem reduces the performance of these methods. There are mainly four factors causing this problem: imbalanced class distribution, sample size, class separability and within-class concept. The existing improvement strategies for class imbalance mainly focus on the first factor but omit other three ones. This paper considers the four factors to propose a comprehensive model called clustering tree. Constructing a clustering tree includes two steps: 1) we first select a clustering algorithm considering the class separability; and then 2) we use this clustering algorithm to construct a tree that can be used to determine if an incoming transaction is illegal. The root node of this tree contains all samples, and we consider both the imbalanced class distribution and the within-class concept when samples are hierarchically divided into sub-nodes during the constructing process.

Several applications in these systems, such as energy management through home appliance identification or activity recognition, adopt Machine Learning (ML) as a practical tool for extracting useful knowledge from raw data. These applications are usually characterized by a sequential stream of data, unlike the classical ML scenario in which the entire data is available during training. For such applications, Stream-based Active Learning (SAL) has been designed as a type of supervised ML in which an expert is asked to label the most informative instances as they arrive. Previous SAL techniques assume that the expert is always available and always labels the data correctly. However, in several applications, such as those mentioned above, the SAL activity interweaves with the everyday life of regular residents, who are often not experts, and may also not always be willing to participate in the labeling process. In this paper, we discuss the importance of user-centered ML, and show how taking into account realistic models of user behavior significantly improves the accuracy and reduces the training period of smart environment applications based on SAL. We consider two use cases, namely appliance identification and activity recognition. Results based on real data sets show an improvement in terms of accuracy up to 55.38%.",,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9027329,Cyber-Physical-Systems (CPSs);Internet of Things (IoT);Smart City;Smart Home;Machine Learning;Active Learning;User-Centered,Labeling;Home appliances;Training;Smart homes;Smart cities;Machine learning;Energy management,,,,,44,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,

One of the promising applications of the integration of IoT and AI is smart city. The typical design pattern of smart cities is to install cameras and various sensors as many spots as possible and connect them to data center servers that can make smart decisions based on the inputs from the cameras and sensors. In such structure, network bandwidth may hinder the real-time processing because sensory data should be sent to the servers in the remote location before making any decision. To solve this problem, recent a few studies demonstrated edge computing. In edge computing, IoT devices can handle basic recognition. Thus, only sophisticated inputs that are not handled by IoT devices are sent to remote servers.

Commercial, industrial and residential buildings often incorporate systems used to determine occupancy. However, relatively simple sensor technology and control algorithms limit the effectiveness of smart building services. In this paper we propose to replace sensor technology with time series models that can predict the number of occupants at a given location and time. We use Wi-Fi datasets readily available in abundance for smart building services and train Auto Regression Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) time series models. As a use case scenario of smart building services, these models allow forecasting of the number of people at a given time and location in 15, 30 and 60 minutes time intervals at building as well as Access Point (AP) level.

Asynchronous Block Coordinate Descent Method for Large-Scale Nonconvex Problem in Real World Study,R. Liu,Central South University,2019 IEEE 21st International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications; IEEE 17th International Conference on Smart City; IEEE 5th International Conference on Data Science and Systems (HPCC/SmartCity/DSS),,2019,,,2033,2038,"Here comes the era of big data in healthcare, and this era will transform medicine and especially oncology. In the last decade, there has been a growing interest in the potential benefits and the relevance of real world studies (RWS) with to the rapid development of data mining algorithms, as well as large-scale accumulated real world datasets. However, it is beyond the ability of traditional data mining algorithms to solve such large-scale RWS problems due to the large amount of data need to be processed and the difficulty in the problems solving, especially the nonconvex optimization problems. In many cases for these nonconvex problems, the goal is to find a reasonable local minimum, and the main concern is that the iterative updates are easily trapped in saddle points or bad local optima points. In this paper, we aim at minimizing the sum of a smooth nonlinear function and a block-separable nonconvex function involving a large number of block variables subjected to inequality constraints, which covers a wide range of interesting applications appearing in distributed optimization, statistics learning, etc. However, solving such a nonconvex nonlinear optimization problem associated with inequality constraints remains as a challenging task. This is because: 1) it is still an open problem about how to escape from saddle points and bad local optima points using a block coordinate descent method to deal with the nonconvex nonlinear optimization functions; 2) it can be extremely expensive to compute the entire block variables when the problem scale is large. Therefore, we propose a novel parallel first-order optimization method, called as Asynchronous block coordinate descent with Time Perturbation (ATP), which utilizing the time perturbation technique that escapes from saddle points and local optima points. We present a randomized block variable selection rule of the proposed method, as well as the iteration complexity. Experiments conducted on typical machine learning problems in RWS, i.e., folded concave linear regression, validate the efficacy of our optimization method. In particular, the experiment results demonstrate that time perturbation could greatly help the proposed algorithm escape from saddle points and local optima in the nonconvex part, which provides a promising way to tackle nonconvex optimization problems employing block coordinate descent.",,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8855671,Nonconvex Optimization;Asynchronous Block Coordinate Descent Method;Time Perturbation;Real World Study,Optimization;Perturbation methods;Linear programming;Input variables;Data mining;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms,Big Data;concave programming;convex programming;data mining;gradient methods;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;regression analysis,large-scale nonconvex problem;big data;large-scale accumulated real world datasets;large-scale RWS problems;saddle points;smooth nonlinear function;block-separable nonconvex function;inequality constraints;distributed optimization;nonconvex nonlinear optimization functions;parallel first-order optimization method;randomized block variable selection rule;data mining algorithms;machine learning problems;real world studies;statistics learning;asynchronous block coordinate descent with time perturbation method;local optima points,,1,24,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,

The major restriction of planning agricultural afforestation programs and optimize the carbon sequestration potential of these programs is the decrease of food productivity. The spatial heterogeneity of both the food productivity and carbon sequestration potential further complicate this problem. In this article, we demonstrate how the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method can be formulated and applied to address this problem. Based on the spatial estimation of food productivity and carbon sequestration potential, we formulated a PSO model to generate the optimal zoning of agricultural afforestation area and optimize the carbon sequestration potential with different scenarios of food productivity decrease ratio in Beijing, China. Results show that our method can be used to optimize the carbon sequestration potential of agricultural afforestation under the restriction of decrease in food productivity. With the application of our method, a significantly higher carbon sequestration potential can be achieved with a small loss of the current food productivity, e.g. 8.80-12.47 Tg C (14.82 - 20.93 % of the maximum carbon sequestration potential) can be sequestrated with 5% loss of current food productivity.

An Ensemble Model for Short-Term Traffic Prediction in Smart City Transportation System,G. Zheng; W. K. Chai; V. Katos,Bournemouth University; Bournemouth University; Bournemouth University,2019 IEEE Global Communications Conference (GLOBECOM),,2019,,,1,6,"Smart city visions aim to offer citizens with intelligent services in various aspects of life. The services envisioned have been significantly enhanced with the proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology offering real-time and ubiquitous monitoring capability. In this paper, we focus on the short-term traffic flow prediction problem based on real-world traffic data as one critical component of a smart city. In contrast to long-term traffic prediction, accurate prediction of short-term traffic flow facilitates timely traffic management and rapid response. We develop and study a novel ensemble model (EM) based on long short term memory (LSTM), deep autoencoder (DAE) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Our approach takes into account both temporal and spatial characteristics of the traffic conditions. We evaluate our proposal against well-known existing prediction models. We use two real traffic data (California and London roadways) with different characteristics to train and test the models. Our results indicate that our proposed ensemble model achieves the most accurate predictions (approx. 97.50% and approx. % accuracy) and is robust against high variance traffic flow.",,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014061,,Predictive models;Data models;Feature extraction;Autoregressive processes;Logic gates;Smart cities;Machine learning,,,,,27,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,

We believe RL is an ideal approach since this task falls under the control-optimization problem where RL has yielded optimal results in previous work. The magnitude and scale of a DH system complexity incurs the curse of dimensionalities and model, hereby making RL a good choice since it provides a solution for the problem. To assist RL even further with the curse of dimensionalities, we intend to investigate the use of SL to reduce the state space. To achieve this, we shall use historical data to generate a heat load sub-model for each home. We believe using the output of these sub-models as feedback to the RL algorithm could significantly reduce the complexity of the learning task. Also, it could reduce convergence time for the RL algorithm. The desired goal is to achieve a realtime application, which takes operational actions when it receives new direct feedback.

Data will have to be collected and processed in order to extract knowledge out of it, to feed users' and smart city applications. A typical approach to process such big amounts of data is to i) gather all the collected data on the cloud through wireless pervasive networks, and ii) perform data analysis operations exploiting machine learning techniques. However, according to many studies, this centralised cloud-based approach may not be sustainable from a networking point of view. The joint effect of data-intensive users' multimedia applications and smart cities monitoring and control applications may result in severe network congestions making applications hardly usable. To cope with this problem, in this paper we propose a distributed machine learning approach that does not require to move data in a centralised cloud platform, but processes it directly where it is collected. Specifically, we exploit Hypothesis Transfer Learning (HTL) to build a distributed machine learning framework. In our framework we train a series of partial models, each ''residing'' in a location where a subset of the dataset is generated. We then refine the partial models by exchanging them between locations, thus obtaining a unique complete model. Using an activity classification task on a reference dataset as a concrete example, we show that the classification accuracy of the HTL model is comparable with that of a model built out of the complete dataset, but the cost in term of network overhead is dramatically reduced. We then perform a sensitiveness analysis to characterise how the overhead depends on key parameters. It is also worth noticing that the HTL approach is suitable for applications dealing with privacy sensitive data, as data can stay where they are generated, and do not need to be transferred to third parties, i.e., to a cloud provider, to extract knowledge out of it.",,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501696,,Training;Data mining;Smart cities;Data models;Support vector machines;Cloud computing;Mobile communication,cloud computing;data analysis;data privacy;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;multimedia computing;pattern classification;smart phones,hypothesis transfer learning;HTL;data computing;smart city;mobile computing;smart phone;knowledge extraction;wireless pervasive network;data analysis;multimedia application;distributed machine learning;activity classification task;data privacy;cloud provider,,8,20,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,

In order to occupy more market shares, merchants sometimes run big promotions on particular dates. Unfortunately, many of the attracted buyers are one-time deal hunters, and these promotions may have little long lasting impact on sales. To alleviate this problem, it is important for merchants to identify who can be converted into repeated buyers. By targeting on these potential loyal customers, merchants can greatly reduce the promotion cost and enhance the return on investment. According to the idea of ensemble learning in machine learning, this paper proposes a two-layer model fusion algorithm(TMFBG) based on GBDT to predict repeat buyers.

In many cases, these people lost their motion ability and consciousness. For example, after a strong earthquake struck, people might first be hit by heavy objects or forced down by dropped objects, and then lost consciousness. The situation becomes dangerous if trapped people cannot be detected and pull out in time. Therefore, finding trapped victims inside a building in time becomes a very important issue for responders and command centers. Due to the popularity of video surveillance systems, several image-based methods have been proposed to detect trapped people by using machine learning technology to identify human features. However, trapped victims were usually covered by fallen objects. Detecting human features of trapped victims could be difficult. In this paper, we proposed, Indoor Trapped-Victim Detection System (iTEDS), an image recognition system to identify and recognize trapped victims inside a building. Given a video, we track people and big objects, such as bookcases, tables, chests and so on, inside a building. If a huge object falls on top of a person and makes the person unable to move for a while, we mark the person as a trapped victim.

A modern urban city has over a million of cars on its roads but it does not have enough parking space. Moreover, most of the contemporary researchers propose management of the data on cloud. However, this method may be considered as an issue since the raw data is sent promptly from distributed sensors to the parking area via cloud and then received back after it is processed. This is considered as an expensive technique in terms of the data transmission as well as the energy cost and consumption.

To address these issues, the application of machine learning techniques to analyze car mobility data has become more and more appealing. This paper focuses on forecasting the number of cars available in a restricted urban area in the short term (e.g., in the next 2 hours).

The communications take place mainly between cluster of worker nodes for training data and parameter servers for maintaining a global trained model. For fast convergence the worker nodes and parameter servers have to frequently exchange billions of parameters to quickly broadcast updates and minimize staleness. Demand on the bandwidth becomes even higher with the introduction of dedicated GPUs in the computation. While RDMA-capable network has a great potential to provide sufficiently high bandwidth, its current use over TCP/IP or tied to particular programming models, such as MPI, limits its capability to break the bandwidth bottleneck. In this work we propose iRDMA, an RDMA-based parameter server architecture optimized for high-performance network environment supporting both GPU- and CPU-based training. It utilizes native asynchronous RDMA verbs to achieve network line speed while minimizing the communication processing cost on both worker and parameter-server sides.

Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily.

Brands want their customers to be in pleasing subliminal scented2 environments because, as research has shown, even a few micro-particles of scent can do a lot of marketing's heavy lifting, from improving consumer perceptions of quality to increasing the number of store visits. Hence, customer venues such as hotels, retail showrooms, casinos, hospitable and other captive audience places employ HVAC (Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) based scent diffusion system that delivers a seamless olfactory [2] experience to connect with consumers on a deeper emotional level, resulting in a more memorable experience. Current state of the art of HVAC dispenser systems, however, uses power hungry deployments [3] to monitor and dispense periodically, without accounting venue-patron occupancy ratios and sudden changes in foot traffic numbers. Thus, resulting sub-optimal user experience that might lead to a poor brand engagement and could incur higher operational costs [5] and thus reduce over all return on the investment (ROI). In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to implement intelligent HVAC dispensing that improve venue experience and operational efficiencies through the application of Big Data Technologies, Edge processing and IoT Sensing. Our system combines a lightweight edge anomaly detection algorithm based on Kalman filter and venue ambient condition to foot traffic graph matrix.

Machine learning has been successfully introduced into SpMT to improve its performance. An appropriate sample set is important for machine learning-based (ML-based) thread partition. Conventionally, heuristic rules-based (HR-based) sample generation approach can not generate adaptive samples, which conform to ML-based thread partition platform and characteristics of source applications. A hybrid sample generation approach is proposed. With this method, we firstly automatically generate samples which are mips codes consisting spawning points (SP) and control quasi-independent points (CQIP) by heuristic rules, then manually adjust the positions of SP and CQIP and rebuild pre-computation slice (p-slice) to obtain better performance for every application. During the implementation of this approach, three measures: bias weighting, reservation of optimal solutions, summary of greedy rules are carried out. In this way, we enhance the adjustment frequency for the subroutine with high called number, achieving a stable improvement of speedups. On Prophet, which is a generic SpMT processor to evaluate the performance of multithreaded programs, Olden benchmarks are used to realize the approach. Experiments show that the approach can obtain better sample sets, which deliver a better performance improvement of about 10% on a 32 core than conventional heuristic-based approach.

Traditional sequential SVD algorithms take cubic time which may not be affordable especially when the input matrix is large. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop efficient sequential and parallel SVD algorithms. Jacobi iteration, as one of the most common SVD algorithms, has attracted a lot of attention. Among many algorithms that have been proposed, there are some relaxation schemes that have been proven to be very effective in parallel Jacobi-SVD computing.

The FIFO-guided warning order can process warnings timely when disk failures are rare in data centers. With the growing scale of data centers, the increasing number of disk failures leads to a complex situation that multiple warnings are raised simultaneously, where the FIFO-guided warning order neither processes warnings timely, nor manages warnings properly due to lack of the priority of warnings. Thus, a real-time and finer-grained priority guidance for warning order management is an urgent need. To this end, we turn our attention to the failures since each warning corresponds to a fail event. The key insight is that the interdependence of failures, i.e., the order failure occurred, indicates the order of warning processing. With an accurate failure order, data centers can decrease the probability of data loss and the downtime of latency-sensitive applications by processing urgent warnings in advance. In this paper, we predict the failure order with a LambdaMART model, which is a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm in information retrieval. To avoid overly concerning on the correctness of high-rank warnings in information retrieval, we design a symmetric metric to evaluate the prediction evaluation of failure order.

To command this piece of hardware (start and stop recording, as well as annotate raw data), a mobile application was specifically developed. A total of 70 well-known features both from time and frequency domains that are mostly used in activity recognition were computed over each signal to produce enough discriminating characteristics. Then, two machine learning algorithms (Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors) were employed to classify such data. The proposed method was tested with 9 participants on four soil types with an experimental setup close to real use case situations. Results obtained let us state that a soil-types recognition is not only possible but also accurate and reliable since overall median F-Score measures of 82% and 86% were obtained respectively with the Random Forest and the k-NN classifiers.

Although data-parallel ML systems often engage a perfect error tolerance when synchronizing the model parameters for maximizing parallelism, the synchronization of model parameters may delay in completion, a problem that generally gets worse at a large scale. This paper presents a Bounded Asynchronous Parallel (BAP) model of computation that allows computations using stale model parameters in order to reduce synchronization overheads. In the meanwhile, our BAP model ensures theoretical convergence guarantees for large scale data-parallel ML applications. This model permits distributed workers to use the stale parameters storing in the local cache, instead of waiting until the Parameter Server (PS) produces a new version. This expressively reduces the time workers spend on waiting. Furthermore, the BAP model guarantees the convergence of ML algorithm by bounding the maximum distance of the stale parameters. Experiments conducted on 4 cluster nodes with up to 32 GPUs showed that our model significantly improved the proportion of computing time relative to the waiting time and led to 1.2-2×speedup.

In this paper, we evaluate mobile heterogeneous computing by benchmarking RenderScript, a high performance computing framework in Android system, using 6 selected benchmarks in the area of linear algebra, machine learning and image processing. For each benchmark, both the original version and the RenderScript heterogeneous version are implemented for the performance comparison. We make a thorough study of the performance in terms of computation speedup and power consumption on two smart phone platforms. Our results demonstrate that, compared with original implementation, the increase of computation speed ranges from 2 to 18 by using RenderScript while the power consumption overhead is capped by 75%.

Most existing unattended parking lots suffer from a lack of seamless automation, instead deploying ticketing and payment at ingress and egress points or other systems with heavy user involvement that often form bottlenecks. Similarly, many lots use per-space sensing with expensive networking and power requirements simply to determine space occupancy. Parking solutions that are free from the delay caused by this user burden and infrastructure could experience faster occupancy turnover with lower cost. An ongoing challenge in developing seamless parking experiences is the detection and identification of vehicles in parking spaces without the need for complex and expensive per-space occupancy detection technology. We develop a smart parking solution that uses a single low-power wireless radio technology to seamlessly perform parked vehicle localization and transport of sensor data for use by a central management system. Our solution uses a sparse, self-forming network of dual-mode Bluetooth sensors within a parking area to observe the presence of customized authenticated Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) beacons placed in vehicles parked in the lot. Our localization technique is based on radio fingerprinting using Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values from the beacon, and a random forest machine learning classifier that predicts where the vehicle is parked based on its fingerprint. We implemented our solution in Python on commodity Internet of Things (IoT) hardware and deployed it to a 105 space outdoor parking lot. There, we conducted fingerprinting and prediction experiments. Our results show that our exact-space prediction model evaluates with a high accuracy using radio training data (90.7% correctly identified), and our in-vehicle tests show a promising result (69.17% accurate up to and including 3 spaces away), even without employing tuning and data filtering techniques.

Firstly, DistForest applies master-slave architecture in which system will select some nodes as the primary node to distribute the large tasks to other slave nodes. Secondly, DistForest exploits a multilevel parallel strategy which pushes small tasks to a task queue rather than continues to distribute them among other slaves.
