Access failures in wireless network Base Stations (BSs) produce a phenomenon called “sleeping cells”, which can render a cell catatonic without triggering any alarms or provoking immediate effects on cell performance, making them difficult to discover. To detect this kind of failure, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) framework based on the use of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) statistics from the BS under study, as well as those of the neighboring BSs with propensity to have their performance affected by the failure. A simple way to define neighbors is to use adjacency in Voronoi diagrams. In this paper, we propose a much more realistic approach based on the nature of radio-propagation and the way devices choose the BS to which they send access requests. We gather data from large-scale simulators that use real location data for BSs and IoT devices and pose the detection problem as a supervised binary classification problem. We measure the effects on the detection performance by the size of time aggregations of the data, the level of traffic and the parameters of the neighborhood definition. The Extra Trees and Naive Bayes classifiers achieve Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.996 and 0.993, respectively, with False Positive Rates (FPRs) under 5%. The proposed framework holds potential for other pattern recognition tasks in smart-city wireless infrastructures, that would enable the monitoring, prediction and improvement of the Quality of Service (QoS) experienced by IoT applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2983383","NSERC and Ericsson(grant numbers:CRDPJ 520642); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9046847","Failure detection;IoT;M2M communications;machine learning;sleeping cells;smart cities;wireless networks","Internet of Things;Telecommunications;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Smart cities;Cellular networks","Bayes methods;computational geometry;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern recognition;quality of service","smart-city IoT telecommunications infrastructure;Internet of Things;access failures;cell catatonic;Voronoi diagrams;access requests;IoT devices;supervised binary classification problem;smart-city wireless infrastructures;sleeping cell detection;infrastructure failure detection;wireless network base stations;key performance indicators statistics;machine learning;Quality of Service;receiver operating characteristic","","7","","33","CCBY","25 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Very recently, the research focus has shifted toward processing of massive amount of data continuously generated within a city environment, e.g., physical and participatory sensing data on traffic flow, air quality, and health care. Techniques from computational intelligence have been applied to process and analyze such data, and to extract useful knowledge that helps citizens better understand their surroundings and informs city authorities to provide better and more efficient public services. Deep learning, as a relatively new paradigm in computational intelligence, has attracted substantial attention of the research community and demonstrated greater potential over traditional techniques. This paper provides a survey of the latest research on the convergence of deep learning and smart city from two perspectives: while the technique-oriented review pays attention to the popular and extended deep learning models, the application-oriented review emphasises the representative application domains in smart cities. Our study showed that there are still many challenges ahead for this emerging area owing to the complex nature of deep learning and wide coverage of smart city applications.

The state-of-the-art in smart health applications is black-box, end-to-end implementations which are neither intended for use with heterogeneous data nor adaptable to a changing set of sensing and actuation.

For smart health, this improves response times for critical situations, more efficient identification of health-related conditions and subsequent actuation in a smart city environment.

At the same time, smart city systems, being very large-scale distributed systems and highly integrated with the physical infrastructure and residents of the city, pose immense security challenges as well. So why don't we take advantage of this data to improve security measures? In this paper we propose the use of data-driven security approaches to secure smart city systems.

However, large-scale deployment of EV charging stations poses multiple challenges to the power grid and public infrastructure. To overcome the issue of prolonged charging time, the simple solution of deploying more charging stations to increase charging capacity does not work due to the strain on power grids and physical space limitations. Therefore, researchers have focused on developing smart scheduling algorithms to manage the demand for public charging using modeling and optimization. More recently, there has been a growing interest in data-driven approaches in modeling EV charging. Consequently, researchers are looking to identify consumer charging behavior pattern that can provide insights and predictive analytics capability.

Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system.

We analyze the common road surface types and irregularities as well as their impact on vehicle motion. In addition to the traditional use of sensors available in smart devices, we utilize the vehicle motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) presently available in most land vehicles. Various land vehicles were used in this paper, spanning different sizes, and year model for extensive road experiments. These trajectories were used to collect and build multiple labeled data sets that were used in the system structure. In order to enhance the performance of the sensor measurements, wavelet packet de-noising is used in this paper to enable efficient classification of road surface anomalies. We adopt statistical, time domain, and frequency domain features to distinguish different road anomalies. The descriptive data sets collected in this paper are used to build, train, and test a system classifier through machine learning techniques to detect and categorize multiple road anomalies with different severity levels. Furthermore, we analyze and assess the capabilities of the smart devices and the other vehicle motion sensors to accurately geo-reference the road surface anomalies.

Mobile cloud computing (MCC) is an effective way to alleviate the limitation of computation capacity by offloading complex tasks from mobile devices (MDs) to central clouds. Besides, mobile-edge computing (MEC) is a promising technology to reduce latency during data transmission and save energy by providing services in a timely manner. However, it is still difficult to solve the task offloading challenges in heterogeneous cloud computing environments, where edge clouds and central clouds work collaboratively to satisfy the requirements of city IoT applications. In this article, we consider the heterogeneity of edge and central cloud servers in the offloading destination selection. To jointly optimize the system utility and the bandwidth allocation for each MD, we establish a hybrid offloading model, including the collaboration of MCC and MEC. A distributed deep learning-driven task offloading (DDTO) algorithm is proposed to generate near-optimal offloading decisions over the MDs, edge cloud server, and central cloud server. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy of the DDTO algorithm, which can effectively and efficiently generate near-optimal offloading decisions in the edge and cloud computing environments. Furthermore, it achieves high performance and greatly reduces the computational complexity when compared with other offloading schemes that neglect the collaboration of heterogeneous clouds. More precisely, the DDTO scheme can improve computational performance by 63%, compared with the local-only scheme.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2996784","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFC0809800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801325); Natural Science Foundation of Tianjin City(grant numbers:18JCQNJC00600); Huawei Innovation Research Program(grant numbers:HO2018085138); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9099242","City Internet of Things (IoT);distributed deep learning;mobile cloud computing (MCC);mobile-edge computing (MEC);task offloading","Task analysis;Cloud computing;Servers;Internet of Things;Urban areas;Machine learning;Mobile handsets","bandwidth allocation;cloud computing;computational complexity;distributed algorithms;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;optimisation;smart cities","computational resources;strict latency requirements;mobile cloud computing;MCC;mobile devices;mobile-edge computing;MEC;heterogeneous cloud computing environments;city IoT applications;offloading destination selection;hybrid offloading model;distributed deep learning-driven task offloading algorithm;near-optimal offloading decisions;edge cloud server;central cloud server;computational complexity;smart city Internet-of-Things applications;DDTO algorithm;bandwidth allocation","","111","","44","IEEE","25 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The selection of suitable car parks could be influenced by multiple factors-e.g., the walking distance to destination, driving and waiting time, parking prices, availability, and accessibility-while the availability of unused parking slots might depend on parking location, events in the area, traffic flow, and weather conditions. This paper presents a set of metrics and techniques to predict the number of available parking slots in city garages with gates. With this aim, we have considered three different predictive techniques, while comparing different approaches. The comparison has been performed according to the data collected in a dozen of garages in the area of Florence by using Sii-Mobility National Research Project and Km4City infrastructure. The resulting solution has demonstrated that a Bayesian regularized neural network exploiting historical data, weather condition, and traffic flow data can offer a robust approach for the implementation of reliable and fast predictions of available slots in terms of flexibility and robustness to critical cases.

To this extent, replay attacks have been one of the most common threats on smart city infrastructure, which compromises authentication in a smart city network. For example, a replay attack may physically damage smart city infrastructure resulting in loss of sensitive data, incurring considerable financial damages. Therefore, towards securing smart cities from reply attacks, intrusion detection systems and frameworks based on deep learning have been proposed in the recent literature. However, the absence of the time dimension of these proposals is a major limitation. Therefore, we have developed a deep learning-based model for replay attack detection in smart cities. The novelty of the proposed methodology resides in the adoption of deep learning based models as an application for detecting replay attacks to improve detection accuracy. The performance of this model is evaluated by applying it to a real life smart city dataset, where replay attacks were simulated. Our results show that the proposed model is capable of distinguishing between normal and attack behaviours with relatively high accuracy. In addition, according to the results, our proposed model outperforms traditional classification and deep learning models.

Different types of end devices generate and collect multimodal information, and substantial data is transmitted to upper nodes. Multimodal machine learning methods process data at edge nodes, and only high-level features are uploaded to the cloud in order to save bandwidth. In this article, we propose a novel multimodal data processing framework based on multiple attention mechanisms. Two distinct attention mechanisms are used to capture inter and intra-modality dependencies and align different modalities together. We conduct experiments on image captioning, a core research hotspot in multimodal machine learning. A unified hierarchical structure extracts features from images and natural language. Matching attention aligns visual and textual information. Besides, we propose a new attention mechanism, positional attention, which finds the relationship of each element within one sensory modality. The hierarchical structure realizes parallel computation in the training phase and speeds up the training of the model.

Nevertheless, various types of sensors will produce an increasing volume of big data along with the implementation of a smart city, where we face redundant and diverse data. Therefore, providing satisfactory QoE will become the major challenge in the big-data-based smart city. In this article, to enhance the QoE, we propose a novel big data architecture consisting of three planes: the data storage plane, the data processing plane, and the data application plane. The data storage plane stores a wide variety of data collected by sensors and originating from different data sources. Then the data processing plane filters, analyzes, and processes the ocean of data to make decisions autonomously for extracting high-quality information. Finally, the application plane initiates the execution of the events corresponding to the decisions delivered from the data processing plane. Under this architecture, we particularly use machine learning techniques, trying to acquire accurate data and deliver precise information to end users.

Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8291121","","Smart cities;Big Data;Hidden Markov models;Cloud computing;Data mining;Learning (artificial intelligence);Analytical models","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);smart cities;town and country planning","big data;machine learning approaches;smart city services;cognitive smart cities;semisupervised deep reinforcement learning","","216","","15","IEEE","13 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The key challenge lies in the difficulty of collecting a sufficient amount of training labels to train a discriminative model for multimodal prediction. One potential solution is to exploit the labels collected from social media users, which is, however, restricted by the negative effect of label noise. Besides, we have quantitatively found that sentiments in different modalities may be independent, which disables the usage of previous multimodal sentiment analysis schemes in our problem. In this paper, we introduce a weakly supervised multimodal deep learning (WS-MDL) scheme toward robust and scalable sentiment prediction. WS-MDL learns convolutional neural networks iteratively and selectively from “weak” emoticon labels, which are cheaply available and noise containing. In particular, to filter out the label noise and to capture the modality dependency, a probabilistic graphical model is introduced to simultaneously learn discriminative multimodal descriptors and infer the confidence of label noise. Extensive evaluations are conducted in a million-scale, real-world microblog sentiment dataset crawled from Sina Weibo.

To this end, in this paper we discuss the problem of novelty detection with multiple coevolving time series data. To capture both the temporal dependence and the interseries relatedness, a multitask nonparametric model is proposed, which can be extended to family of data distributions by adopting the notion of Bregman divergence. Albeit convex, the learning problem can be hard as the time series accumulate. In this regard, an efficient randomized block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed. The model and the algorithm is tested with a real-world application, involving novelty detection and event analysis in smart city power distribution networks with high-resolution multistream measurements. It is shown that the incorporation of interseries relatedness enables the detection of system-level events, which would otherwise be unobservable with traditional methods. The experimental results not only justify the benefits of incorporating information from different sources, but also demonstrate the potential of the proposed multistream analysis tool as one of the core computational components to improve smart city observability, security, and reliability.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2018.2840508","NSF(grant numbers:1640587); Republic of Singapore's National Research Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8370797","Artificial intelligence;electrical fault detection;power system analysis;statistical learning","Time series analysis;Mathematical model;Power systems;Analytical models;Phasor measurement units;Hidden Markov models;Data models","data analysis;distribution networks;learning (artificial intelligence);time series","nonparametric event detection;multiple time series;unprecedented advancement;smart city applications;massive measurement data;system states;classic data analysis;machine learning tools;unique characteristics;multistream measurement data;strong temporal correlation;interstream relatedness;multiple coevolving time series data;temporal dependence;interseries relatedness;multitask nonparametric model;data distributions;Bregman divergence;learning problem;time series accumulate;descent algorithm;real-world application;event analysis;smart city power distribution networks;high-resolution multistream measurements;system-level events;multistream analysis tool;smart city observability;randomized block","","22","","33","IEEE","1 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the limited bandwidth of mobile networks, understanding the user perception of the quality (i.e., Quality of Experience or QoE) of video streaming services is thus paramount for content providers and content-delivery network providers to flexibly configure network bandwidth, video servers, routing devices, and other network resources to save energy in smart cities. Although various video QoE assessment approaches have been proposed using different key performance indicators (KPIs), they all essentially relate to a common parameter: bitrate. However, because YouTube has adopted hyper text transfer protocol over secure socket layer (HTTPS) as its adaptive video streaming method to better protect user privacy and network security, bitrate can no longer be obtained from encrypted video traffic via typical deep packet inspection. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a machine-learning-based bitrate estimation (MBE) approach to parse bitrate information from IP packet level measurements. First, we filter HTTPS YouTube traffic based on the previously established video server IP according to the data packet googlevideo field. Then, we identify the transmission mode according to the traffic characteristics of several previous packets. Next, we identify the bitrates and resolutions of HTTP Live Streaming and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP modes according to the characteristics of video chunks. Finally, for evaluating the effectiveness of MBE, we have chosen the video Mean Opinion Score (vMOS) proposed by a leading telecom vendor as the QoE assessment framework, and have conducted comprehensive experiments to study the impact of bitrate estimation accuracy on its KPIs for the HTTPS YouTube video streaming service. Experimental results show that MBE is a feasible and highly effective QoE evaluation approach to flexibly configure network resources in smart cities.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2811416","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China(grant numbers:2015AA015603); Jiangsu Future Networks Innovation Institute: Prospective Research Project on Future Networks(grant numbers:BY2013095-5-03); Six talent peaks of high level Talents Project of Jiangsu province(grant numbers:2011-DZ024); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8310894","Hyper text transfer protocol over secure socket layer (HTTPS) YouTube;QoE assessment;adaptive streaming;machine learning;smart city","Streaming media;Quality of experience;YouTube;Bit rate;Cryptography;Adaptive systems;Smart cities","cryptography;hypermedia;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of experience;smart cities;social networking (online);telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video servers;video streaming","content-delivery network providers;video servers;smart cities;video QoE assessment approaches;secure socket layer;user privacy;network security;MBE;IP packet level measurements;data packet googlevideo field;HTTPS YouTube video streaming service;vMOS;video mean opinion score;machine-learning-based bitrate estimation approach;HTTPS YouTube traffic characteristics;encrypted YouTube adaptive video streaming service;QoE evaluation approach;HTTP live streaming;video server IP;video traffic encryption;mobile network applications;dynamic adaptive streaming;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;KPI","","19","","52","OAPA","9 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We formulate the prediction problem as a binary classification problem and consider a variety of machine learning methods, including kernelized and sparse Support Vector Machines (SVMs), sparse logistic regression, and random forests. To strike a balance between accuracy and interpretability of the prediction, which is important in a medical setting, we propose two novel methods: K -LRT, a likelihood ratio test-based method, and a Joint Clustering and Classification (JCC) method which identifies hidden patient clusters and adapts classifiers to each cluster.

In the IoMT, the devices, e.g., Multimedia Sensor Nodes (MSNs), are capable of generating both multimedia and non-multimedia data. The generated data are forwarded to a cloud server via a Base Station (BS). However, it is possible that the Internet connection between the BS and the cloud server may be temporarily down. The limited computational resources restrict the MSNs from holding the captured data for a longer time. In this situation, mobile sinks can be utilized to collect data from MSNs and upload to the cloud server. However, this data collection may create privacy issues, such as revealing identities and location information of MSNs. Therefore, there is a need to preserve the privacy of MSNs during mobile data collection. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving-based data collection and analysis (P2DCA) framework for IoMT applications. The proposed framework partitions an underlying wireless multimedia sensor network into multiple clusters. Each cluster is represented by a Cluster Head (CH). The CHs are responsible to protect the privacy of member MSNs through data and location coordinates aggregation. Later, the aggregated multimedia data are analyzed on the cloud server using a counter-propagation artificial neural network to extract meaningful information through segmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms the existing privacy-preserving schemes, and can be used to collect multimedia data in various IoMT applications.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2904349","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DP170100136,LP140100816); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8680760","IoMT;MSNs;privacy;aggregation;clusters;counter-propagation artificial neural network","Cloud computing;Servers;Privacy;Data privacy;Data collection;Security;Machine learning algorithms","data privacy;Internet;multimedia communication;wireless sensor networks","IoMT applications;smart city applications;traffic management;generated data;cloud server;Base Station;mobile data collection;aggregated multimedia data;Internet of Multimedia Things;multimedia sensor nodes;internet connection;wireless multimedia sensor network;privacy-preserving schemes;privacy-preserving-based data collection;P2DCA framework","","45","","25","IEEE","2 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To relieve the network congestion and improve the traffic load balance, in this paper, we propose an intelligent software defined C-V2X network framework to enable flexible and low-complexity traffic offloading by decoupling the network data plane from the control plane. In the data plane, the cellular traffic offloading and the vehicle assisted traffic offloading are jointly performed. In the control plane, deep learning is deployed to reduce the software defined network (SDN) control complexity and improve the traffic offloading efficiency. Under the proposed framework, we investigate the traffic offloading problem, which can be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. Specifically, the first objective maximizes the cellular access point (AP) throughput with consideration of the load balance by associating the users with the APs. The second objective maximizes the vehicle throughput with consideration of the vehicle trajectory by associating the delay-insensitive users with the vehicles. The two objectives are coupled by the association between the cellular APs and the vehicles. A deep learning based online-offline approach is proposed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The online stage decouples the optimization problem into two sub-problems and utilizes the `Pareto optimal' to find the solutions. The offline stage utilizes deep learning to learn from the historical optimization information of the online stage and helps predict the optimal solutions with reduced complexity.

In this direction, battery-powered electric bus systems have been considered widely for ensuring flexibility, operation cost, and lesser pollutants emission. Industry 4.0 provides automation through a cyber-physical system (CPS), the interconnection of bus system entities with industrial internet-of-things (IIoT), remote information availability through cloud computing and scientific disciplines (human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, machine learning etc.) integration. In this work, a discrete event-based simulation-optimization approach is integrated that take care of bus energy consumption according to real-time city's passenger needs and on-road friction levels. The proposed simulation optimization methodology utilizes multi-objective with dependent and independent variables for optimizing the overall system performance. In simulation optimization, objective functions are designed to tackle battery consumption, Internet-of-Thing (IoT) network performance, cloud operations efficiency and smart scientific discipline integration. Simulation parameters are based on a real-time bus system which is further analyzed, filtered and adapted as per the needs of the system. In another analysis, supercharger's capacities are varied to evaluate the performance of the proposed system and identify the low cost and efficient smart transportation system. Simulation results show different scenarios for variations in the number of buses, charging stations, bus-depots, mobile charging facilities, and bus-schedules. Simulation results show that the average passenger's waiting time in the waiting is (after ticket booking) varies between 0.2 minutes to 0.7 minutes in real-time traffic conditions. In similar traffic conditions, total passenger's time in system (ticket booking to travel) varies between 41.6 minutes (for 24 hours) to 45.5 minutes (for 1 year). In the simulation, priorities are given to those dependent and independent variables which save the battery consumption and elongate the utilization of buses. Lastly, it is also observed that the proposed system is suitable for resource-constraint devices because Gate Equivalent (GE) calculation shows that the proposed system can be implemented between 1986 GEs (communicational cost without confidentiality and authentication) and 7939 GEs (computational cost with HMAC for authentication in data storage).

The inherent difficulty of interpreting radar signals can be overcome using deep learning techniques to leverage the capabilities of monitoring sensors with a minimum of human intervention. In this paper, we use a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying radar images in order to detect vacant parking spaces with a 77-GHz imaging radar. Although training CNNs for radar-image classification is challenging due to poor generalization performance caused by the lack of labeled training data, the modified architecture takes into account the properties of the radar image in order to introduce prior information into the model and improve performance. A MIMO-FMCW radar is utilized to render a slant-range image of a parking scenario, and the image patches corresponding to each parking location are classified independently in the CNN. Since the radiation pattern of a MIMO array varies as a function of the scanning angle, the corresponding spatial coordinate of each patch is included as an additional feature in the upper layers of the network. This allows the model to combine local features from each patch with global scenario information in order to learn robust features that generalize properly to new scenarios. Several models are trained end to end with data from four different parking scenarios and evaluated in a 4-fold cross-validation scheme, and performance is improved when spatial prior information is included.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2857007","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8412486","Convolutional neural networks;MIMO radar;parking monitoring;smart cities","Radar imaging;Feature extraction;Sensors;Data models;Monitoring;Machine learning","CW radar;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;FM radar;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);millimetre wave radar;MIMO radar;radar detection;radar imaging;smart cities;traffic information systems","77-GHz imaging radar;radar-image classification;slant-range image;parking scenario;image patches;spatial prior information;MIMO-FMCW radar-based parking monitoring application;modified convolutional neural network;smart city applications;radar signals;CNN training;performance improvement;radiation pattern;MIMO array;4-fold cross-validation;deep learning;vacant parking space detection;frequency 77 GHz","","21","","23","OAPA","18 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mobile computing takes full advantage of the computing power and communication capabilities of various sensing devices and uses these devices to form a computing cluster. When using such clusters for training of distributed machine learning models, the load imbalance and network transmission delay result in low efficiency of model training. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed machine learning parameter communication consistency model based on the parameter server idea, which is called the limited synchronous parallel model. The model is based on the fault-tolerant characteristics of the machine learning algorithm, and it dynamically limits the size of the synchronization barrier of the parameter server, reduces the synchronization communication overhead, and ensures the accuracy of the model training; thus, the model realizes finite asynchronous calculation between the worker nodes and gives full play to the overall performance of the cluster.

Then, it transforms the video data into useful information, providing services to IoT or smart city applications. However, collecting raw video data directly to the cloud server is merely possible due to network bandwidth limitations and data privacy concerns. One possible solution is to adopt federated learning, which enables edge devices to collaboratively train a shared model without sending the raw data to the cloud. Unfortunately, this scheme cannot directly be applied to the targeted scenario since it assumes labeled data for training, and only at the cloud, we have the human power and time to label the video data. Thus, to tackle those issues, we propose an edge learning system based on semisupervised learning and federated learning technologies. The system trains AI models at edge devices using an improved semisupervised learning scheme and periodically uploads the training results to the cloud server to form a single model by adapting the federated learning technology. Then, we observe that in the real world, the data on the end devices are nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) such that it may cause weight divergence during training and result in a considerable decrease in the model performance. Therefore, we propose a new operation called federated swapping (FedSwap) to replace partial federated learning operations based on a few shared data during federated training to alleviate the adverse impact of weight divergence. We evaluate our system on both image classification using the state-of-the-art benchmark data and object detection using real-world video data. The experimental results show that the proposed system can have up to 5.9% higher accuracy of object detection for the video analysis applications by fully utilizing unlabeled data, compared with the situation that only labeled data are used.

The study of the spatial distribution of urban Tair was thus far limited by the low spatial resolution of traditional data sources. Volunteered geographic information provides alternative data with higher spatial density, with citizen weather stations monitoring Tair continuously in hundreds or thousands of locations within a single city. In this article, the aim was to predict the spatial distribution of nocturnal Tair in Berlin, Germany, one day in advance at a 30-m resolution using open-source remote sensing and geodata from Landsat and Urban Atlas, crowdsourced Tair data, and machine learning (ML) methods. Results were tested with a “leave-one-date-out” training scheme (testingcrowd) and reference Tair data (testingref). Three ML algorithms were compared-Random Forest (RF), Stochastic Gradient Boosting, and Model Averaged Neural Network. The optimal model based on accuracy and computational speed is RF, with an average root mean square error (RMSE) for testingcrowd of 1.16 °C (R2 = 0.512) and RMSE for testingref of 1.97 °C (R2 = 0.581). Overall, the most important geographic information system (GIS) predictors were morphometric parameters and albedo. The proposed method relies on open-source datasets and can, therefore, be adapted to many cities worldwide.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2020.3019696","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(grant numbers:GRK 2032-2); DFG; Heat waves in Berlin, Germany—urban climate modifications(grant numbers:SCHE 750/15-1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9178414","Air temperature;albedo;citizen weather stations (CWS);crowdsourcing;Landsat;urban climate;urban heat island (UHI);volunteered geographic information","Remote sensing;Heating systems;Meteorology;Urban areas;Land surface;Sociology;Statistics","atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;crowdsourcing;geographic information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;thermal pollution;weather forecasting","higher spatial density;citizen weather stations;geographic information system predictors;geodata;Landsat;leave-one-date-out training scheme;alternative data;volunteered geographic information;traditional data sources;low spatial resolution;urban Tair;early warning system;Smart City concept;spatial distribution;higher energy consumption;higher mortality rates;higher nocturnal air temperature;urban heat island effect;Urban areas;crowdsourced weather data;modeling air temperature;summer nights;Model Averaged Neural Network;machine learning methods;crowdsourced Tair data;Urban Atlas;open-source remote sensing;Germany;Berlin;nocturnal Tair;temperature 1.16 degC;temperature 1.97 degC","","22","","69","CCBY","26 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Schema.org provides semantic interoperability to structure heterogeneous data on the Web. An extension of this vocabulary for the IoT domain (iot.schema.org) is an ongoing research effort to address semantic interoperability for the Web of Things (WoT). To design this vocabulary, a central challenge is to identify the main topics (concepts and properties) automatically from existing knowledge in IoT applications. We designed knowledge extraction for the WoT (KE4WoT) to automatically identify the most important topics from literature ontologies of three different IoT application domains: 1) smart home; 2) smart city; and 3) smart weather-based on our corpus consisting of 4500 full-text conference and journal articles to utilize domain-specific knowledge encoded within IoT publications. Despite the importance of automatically identifying the relevant topics for iot.schema.org, up to know there is no study dealing with this issue. To evaluate the extracted topics, we compare the descriptiveness of these topics for the ten most popular ontologies in the three domains with empirical evaluations of 23 domain experts.

Then, traffic identification or classification is performed by combining both. This paper proposes an end-to-end IoT traffic classification method relying on a deep learning aided capsule network for the sake of forming an efficient classification mechanism that integrates feature extraction, feature selection, and classification model.

The realization of these applications hinges on a data acquisition structure that gathers its data from a countless number of sensors, either deployed for predefined tasks (hard sensing) or built into the mobile devices of smart city residents (soft sensing). At the core of this big data infrastructure lie the 5Vs: veracity, volume, velocity, variety, and value. The soft sensing component of a smart city sensing network is particularly affected by 3Vs: veracity, volume, and velocity. To address the unique challenges of big data, recommender systems, statistical reputation systems, and context analysis are used to ensure the veracity of acquired data, machine learning algorithms are applied to handle the data volume, and data analytics algorithms are implemented to manage data velocity. Despite its seemingly insurmountable size, the acquired data is highly redundant, and systematic use of machine intelligence and data analytics can facilitate processing by extracting only the relevant information; in this article, we study the role of these algorithms through the lens of the 3Vs in facilitating soft sensing within the framework of smart city applications.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8291118","","Intelligent sensors;Smart cities;Sensor systems;Recommender systems;Data analysis;Big Data","Big Data;data acquisition;data analysis;driver information systems;home automation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;recommender systems;sensors;smart cities;town and country planning;traffic engineering computing","futuristic applications;mobile devices;context analysis;smart roads warn drivers;unoccupied parking spaces location;fully automated homes;fully automated workplaces;data velocity;data analytics algorithms;data volume;machine learning algorithms;statistical reputation systems;smart city sensing network;soft sensing component;big data infrastructure;data acquisition structure;smart environment;smart parking;bad traffic conditions;smart transportation;machine intelligence;recommender systems","","48","","15","IEEE","13 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The dictionary learning (DL) method is vital to the sparse representation, and the discriminative power of the learned dictionary determines the performance of ReID. Unlike previous approaches that only added constraints in DL, we propose a discriminative dictionary learning model (DDLM) that learns the discriminative dictionary by transforming the dictionary representation space in the training process. We determine the statistical distribution from the training data and divide the data into two categories according to the contribution for sparse representation: the high-contribution data and low-contribution data. Then, we extend the information space that contains the most high-contribution data and shrink the remaining parts. As the representation space of the dictionary is transformed, the solving process is modified accordingly. The experiments on the benchmark datasets (CAVIAR4REID, ETHZ, and i-LIDS) demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905552","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB0505500,2018YFB0505501); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61861166002); Macao Science and Technology Development Fund(grant numbers:138/2016/A3); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:YWF-19-BJ-J-187); Program of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities; China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:201806025026); HAWKEYE Group; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8668409","Piecewise linear transformation;discriminative dictionary learning;sparse representation;person re-identification","Dictionaries;Machine learning;Training data;Training;Feature extraction;Sparse matrices;Measurement","feature extraction;image classification;image representation;statistical distributions","sparse representation;discriminative power;learned dictionary;discriminative dictionary learning model;dictionary representation space;training process;training data;high-contribution data;low-contribution data;heuristic transformation;person re-identification;sparse representation-based classification;DDLM;statistical distribution;discriminative feature extraction;person ReID;surveillance applications;target association","","1","","57","OAPA","17 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts.

Accurate indoor localization plays a vital role in LBS. The ability to localize various subjects in the area of interest facilitates further ubiquitous environments. Specifically, device free localization using wireless signals is getting increased attention as human location is estimated using its impact on the surrounding wireless signals without any active device tagged with subject. In this paper, we propose MuDLoc, the first multi-view discriminant learning approach for device free indoor localization using both amplitude and phase features of Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple Access Points (APs). The same location oriented CSI data can be observed by different APs, thus generating multiple distinct even heterogeneous samples. Multi-view learning is an emerging technique in machine learning which improve performance by utilizing diversity from different view data. In MuDLoc, the localization is modeled as a pattern matching problem, where the target location is predicted based on similarity measure of CSI features of an unknown location with those of the training locations. MuDLoc implements Generalized Inter-view and Intra-view Discriminant Correlation Analysis (GI2DCA), a discriminative feature extraction approach that incorporates inter-view and intra-view class associations while maximizing pairwise correlations across multi-view data sets. Experimental results from two cluttered environments show that MuDLoc can estimate location with high accuracy which outperforms other benchmark approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9043538","Indoor localization;device free;multi-view discriminant learning;amplitude and phase features;CSI","Wireless communication;Correlation;Performance evaluation;Feature extraction;OFDM;Communication system security;Pattern matching","correlation methods;feature extraction;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-access systems;pattern matching;telecommunication computing","pattern matching problem;GI2DCA;location based service;multiview data sets;intraview class associations;generalized interview and intraview discriminant correlation analysis;discriminative feature extraction approach;target location;machine learning;multiple distinct even heterogeneous samples;CSI data;multiple Access Points;Channel State Information;device free indoor localization;MuDLoc;wireless signals;human location;smart city;LBS;multiview Discriminant learning approach","","14","","51","CCBY","20 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The openness, virtualization, and ubiquitous access traits of the combination of CPS and cloud computing may cause coupling problems. When malicious users or attackers simultaneously request the same physical nodes, it may lead to a failure of services as well as a security threat to the system. In this article, we design a low-coupling system based on the edge computing platform to counter coupling problems. The edge computing platform acts as a middleware platform and provides the scheduling method. Based on the edge computing platform and artificial intelligence technology, we design two buffer queues to reduce the coupling degree of the system in parallel.

To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT.

In this paper, a swarm intelligence algorithm is proposed to search for novel architectures without human intervention that can achieve comparable performance to those of human-designed architectures. This work is inspired by current neural architecture search approaches based on reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm. However, not much attention is paid towards swarm intelligence metaheuristics-based neural architecture search. A framework is proposed for automatically designing neural architectures based on a swarm intelligence metaheuristic: Crow Search Algorithm. First, Crow Search Algorithm is integrated with binary network representation. To make it compatible for Neural Architecture Search, the original distance metric is replaced with hamming distance-based similarity measure. Second, the tuning parameters of Crow Search Algorithm are reduced by replacing the static flight length parameter with our dynamic flight length distribution algorithm. Third, the target selection method (random selection) is replaced by tournament select method. The proposed framework is used to search for architectures on MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets and achieved 0.18%, 3.48%, and 15.64% test error, respectively. Furthermore, small-scale transfer experiments are conducted to search architectures for Tiny ImageNet and achieved 34.43% test error. Nonparametric statistical analysis is performed to validate the impact of each modification in improving the quality of search space exploration. The proposed framework has achieved comparable performance with the state-of-the-art approaches, with a comparatively simpler approach and minimum human intervention.

It has become an active research issue of great concern in recent years. However, most algorithms of the existing studies are powerless for large-scale and high-dimensional data, and the intermediate data extracted by some methods that can handle high-dimensional data will consume lots of storage space. In this paper, we propose a novel sparse representation framework that learns dictionaries based on the latent space of variational auto-encoder. For large-scale data sets, it can play the role of dimensionality reduction to obtain hidden information, and extract more high-level features than hand-crafted features. At the same time, for the storage of normal information, the space cost can be greatly reduced. To verify the versatility and performance of the proposed learning algorithm, we have experimented on different types of anomaly detection tasks, including KDD-CUP data set for network intrusion detection, Mnist data set for image anomaly detection, and UCSD pedestrian's data set for abnormal event detection in surveillance videos. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms competing algorithms in all kinds of anomaly detection tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2848210","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672133,61632007); 111 Project(grant numbers:B17008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8386760","Anomaly detection;campus surveillance video;dictionary learning","Anomaly detection;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Dictionaries;Data models;Monitoring","data mining;feature extraction;image coding;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;security of data;video surveillance","variational auto-encoder;security area;network monitoring;high-dimensional data;storage space;sparse representation framework;latent space;large-scale data sets;dimensionality reduction;high-level features;learning algorithm;anomaly detection tasks;KDD-CUP data;network intrusion detection;Mnist data;image anomaly detection;UCSD pedestrian;abnormal event detection","","110","","35","OAPA","15 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
