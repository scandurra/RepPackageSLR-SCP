The recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and the evolution in big data analytics (BDA) technologies have provided an open opportunity to develop highly needed disaster resilient smart city environments. In this paper, we propose and discuss the novel reference architecture and philosophy of a disaster resilient smart city (DRSC) through the integration of the IoT and BDA technologies. The proposed architecture offers a generic solution for disaster management activities in smart city incentives. A combination of the Hadoop Ecosystem and Spark are reviewed to develop an efficient DRSC environment that supports both real-time and offline analysis. The implementation model of the environment consists of data harvesting, data aggregation, data pre-processing, and big data analytics and service platform. A variety of datasets (i.e., smart buildings, city pollution, traffic simulator, and twitter) are utilized for the validation and evaluation of the system to detect and generate alerts for a fire in a building, pollution level in the city, emergency evacuation path, and the collection of information about natural disasters (i.e., earthquakes and tsunamis). The evaluation of the system efficiency is measured in terms of processing time and throughput that demonstrates the performance superiority of the proposed architecture.

AVs are envisaged to evolve to a service rather than a product in the future. To provide best user experience of such services, three primary factors, namely, waiting time, travel time, and supply of AV services, are taken into consideration in a multiobjective optimization. Conventional optimization of services relies on traffic flow analysis over a queuing network model. However, due to the mobility of vehicles and the transfer uncertainty of road networks, the queuing network analysis is too complicated and practically intractable. For accuracy and convenient processing, network calculus (NC) is extended to model the queueing problem in this paper. The optimal number of available AVs can be identified by guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. The satisfaction of AV services can be viewed as a supply and demand problem, and optimized by bipartite graph matching. In order to reduce the average travel time, especially for rush hours with heavy traffic, we further propose a new online AVs fleet management scheme with congestion control for smart cities. It is shown that the intelligent management of AV fleet can be efficiently achieved, outperforming the cases of traditional vehicles.

Very recently, the research focus has shifted toward processing of massive amount of data continuously generated within a city environment, e.g., physical and participatory sensing data on traffic flow, air quality, and health care. Techniques from computational intelligence have been applied to process and analyze such data, and to extract useful knowledge that helps citizens better understand their surroundings and informs city authorities to provide better and more efficient public services. Deep learning, as a relatively new paradigm in computational intelligence, has attracted substantial attention of the research community and demonstrated greater potential over traditional techniques. This paper provides a survey of the latest research on the convergence of deep learning and smart city from two perspectives: while the technique-oriented review pays attention to the popular and extended deep learning models, the application-oriented review emphasises the representative application domains in smart cities.

The drivers include increasing demands for ubiquitous, preventive, and personalized healthcare, to be provided to the public at reduced risks and costs. Mobile cloud computing could potentially meet the future healthcare demands by enabling anytime, anywhere capture and analyses of patients' data. However, network latency, bandwidth, and reliability are among the many challenges hindering the realization of next-generation healthcare. This paper proposes a ubiquitous healthcare framework, UbeHealth, that leverages edge computing, deep learning, big data, high-performance computing (HPC), and the Internet of Things (IoT) to address the aforementioned challenges. The framework enables an enhanced network quality of service using its three main components and four layers. Deep learning, big data, and HPC are used to predict network traffic, which in turn are used by the Cloudlet and network layers to optimize data rates, data caching, and routing decisions. Application protocols of the traffic flows are classified, enabling the network layer to meet applications' communication requirements better and to detect malicious traffic and anomalous data. Clustering is used to identify the different kinds of data originating from the same application protocols. A proof of concept UbeHealth system has been developed based on the framework. A detailed literature review is used to capture the design requirements for the proposed system.

Crowdsensing approaches for road surface conditions monitoring can benefit smart city road information services. Deteriorated roads induce vehicle damage, traffic congestion, and driver discomfort which influence traffic management. In this paper, we propose a framework for monitoring road surface anomalies. We analyze the common road surface types and irregularities as well as their impact on vehicle motion. In addition to the traditional use of sensors available in smart devices, we utilize the vehicle motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) presently available in most land vehicles. Various land vehicles were used in this paper, spanning different sizes, and year model for extensive road experiments. These trajectories were used to collect and build multiple labeled data sets that were used in the system structure. In order to enhance the performance of the sensor measurements, wavelet packet de-noising is used in this paper to enable efficient classification of road surface anomalies. We adopt statistical, time domain, and frequency domain features to distinguish different road anomalies. The descriptive data sets collected in this paper are used to build, train, and test a system classifier through machine learning techniques to detect and categorize multiple road anomalies with different severity levels.

The key challenge lies in the difficulty of collecting a sufficient amount of training labels to train a discriminative model for multimodal prediction. One potential solution is to exploit the labels collected from social media users, which is, however, restricted by the negative effect of label noise. Besides, we have quantitatively found that sentiments in different modalities may be independent, which disables the usage of previous multimodal sentiment analysis schemes in our problem. In this paper, we introduce a weakly supervised multimodal deep learning (WS-MDL) scheme toward robust and scalable sentiment prediction. WS-MDL learns convolutional neural networks iteratively and selectively from “weak” emoticon labels, which are cheaply available and noise containing. In particular, to filter out the label noise and to capture the modality dependency, a probabilistic graphical model is introduced to simultaneously learn discriminative multimodal descriptors and infer the confidence of label noise.

However, classic data analysis or machine learning tools ignore some unique characteristics of the multistream measurement data, in particular, the coexistence of strong temporal correlation and interstream relatedness. To this end, in this paper we discuss the problem of novelty detection with multiple coevolving time series data. To capture both the temporal dependence and the interseries relatedness, a multitask nonparametric model is proposed, which can be extended to family of data distributions by adopting the notion of Bregman divergence. Albeit convex, the learning problem can be hard as the time series accumulate. In this regard, an efficient randomized block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed.

QoE Assessment of Encrypted YouTube Adaptive Streaming for Energy Saving in Smart Cities,W. Pan; G. Cheng,"School of Cybersecurity, Southeast University, Nanjing, China; School of Cybersecurity, Southeast University, Nanjing, China",IEEE Access,,2018,6,,25142,25156,"Video streaming has become one of the most prevalent mobile applications and uses a substantial portion of the traffic on mobile networks today. With the limited bandwidth of mobile networks, understanding the user perception of the quality (i.e., Quality of Experience or QoE) of video streaming services is thus paramount for content providers and content-delivery network providers to flexibly configure network bandwidth, video servers, routing devices, and other network resources to save energy in smart cities. Although various video QoE assessment approaches have been proposed using different key performance indicators (KPIs), they all essentially relate to a common parameter: bitrate. However, because YouTube has adopted hyper text transfer protocol over secure socket layer (HTTPS) as its adaptive video streaming method to better protect user privacy and network security, bitrate can no longer be obtained from encrypted video traffic via typical deep packet inspection. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a machine-learning-based bitrate estimation (MBE) approach to parse bitrate information from IP packet level measurements. First, we filter HTTPS YouTube traffic based on the previously established video server IP according to the data packet googlevideo field. Then, we identify the transmission mode according to the traffic characteristics of several previous packets. Next, we identify the bitrates and resolutions of HTTP Live Streaming and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP modes according to the characteristics of video chunks. Finally, for evaluating the effectiveness of MBE, we have chosen the video Mean Opinion Score (vMOS) proposed by a leading telecom vendor as the QoE assessment framework, and have conducted comprehensive experiments to study the impact of bitrate estimation accuracy on its KPIs for the HTTPS YouTube video streaming service. Experimental results show that MBE is a feasible and highly effective QoE evaluation approach to flexibly configure network resources in smart cities.",,,,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National High Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China; Jiangsu Future Networks Innovation Institute: Prospective Research Project on Future Networks; Six talent peaks of high level Talents Project of Jiangsu province; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8310894,Hyper text transfer protocol over secure socket layer (HTTPS) YouTube;QoE assessment;adaptive streaming;machine learning;smart city,Streaming media;Quality of experience;YouTube;Bit rate;Cryptography;Adaptive systems;Smart cities,cryptography;hypermedia;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of experience;smart cities;social networking (online);telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;video servers;video streaming,content-delivery network providers;video servers;smart cities;video QoE assessment approaches;secure socket layer;user privacy;network security;MBE;IP packet level measurements;data packet googlevideo field;HTTPS YouTube video streaming service;vMOS;video mean opinion score;machine-learning-based bitrate estimation approach;HTTPS YouTube traffic characteristics;encrypted YouTube adaptive video streaming service;QoE evaluation approach;HTTP live streaming;video server IP;video traffic encryption;mobile network applications;dynamic adaptive streaming;deep packet inspection;hypertext transfer protocol;KPI,,3,52,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

In the IoMT, the devices, e.g., Multimedia Sensor Nodes (MSNs), are capable of generating both multimedia and non-multimedia data. The generated data are forwarded to a cloud server via a Base Station (BS). However, it is possible that the Internet connection between the BS and the cloud server may be temporarily down. The limited computational resources restrict the MSNs from holding the captured data for a longer time. In this situation, mobile sinks can be utilized to collect data from MSNs and upload to the cloud server. However, this data collection may create privacy issues, such as revealing identities and location information of MSNs. Therefore, there is a need to preserve the privacy of MSNs during mobile data collection. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving-based data collection and analysis (P2DCA) framework for IoMT applications. The proposed framework partitions an underlying wireless multimedia sensor network into multiple clusters. Each cluster is represented by a Cluster Head (CH). The CHs are responsible to protect the privacy of member MSNs through data and location coordinates aggregation. Later, the aggregated multimedia data are analyzed on the cloud server using a counter-propagation artificial neural network to extract meaningful information through segmentation.

When using such clusters for training of distributed machine learning models, the load imbalance and network transmission delay result in low efficiency of model training. Therefore, this paper proposes a distributed machine learning parameter communication consistency model based on the parameter server idea, which is called the limited synchronous parallel model. The model is based on the fault-tolerant characteristics of the machine learning algorithm, and it dynamically limits the size of the synchronization barrier of the parameter server, reduces the synchronization communication overhead, and ensures the accuracy of the model training; thus, the model realizes finite asynchronous calculation between the worker nodes and gives full play to the overall performance of the cluster.

The inherent difficulty of interpreting radar signals can be overcome using deep learning techniques to leverage the capabilities of monitoring sensors with a minimum of human intervention. In this paper, we use a modified convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying radar images in order to detect vacant parking spaces with a 77-GHz imaging radar. Although training CNNs for radar-image classification is challenging due to poor generalization performance caused by the lack of labeled training data, the modified architecture takes into account the properties of the radar image in order to introduce prior information into the model and improve performance. A MIMO-FMCW radar is utilized to render a slant-range image of a parking scenario, and the image patches corresponding to each parking location are classified independently in the CNN. Since the radiation pattern of a MIMO array varies as a function of the scanning angle, the corresponding spatial coordinate of each patch is included as an additional feature in the upper layers of the network. This allows the model to combine local features from each patch with global scenario information in order to learn robust features that generalize properly to new scenarios. Several models are trained end to end with data from four different parking scenarios and evaluated in a 4-fold cross-validation scheme, and performance is improved when spatial prior information is included.",,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8412486,Convolutional neural networks;MIMO radar;parking monitoring;smart cities,Radar imaging;Feature extraction;Sensors;Data models;Monitoring;Machine learning,CW radar;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;FM radar;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);millimetre wave radar;MIMO radar;radar detection;radar imaging;smart cities;traffic information systems,77-GHz imaging radar;radar-image classification;slant-range image;parking scenario;image patches;spatial prior information;MIMO-FMCW radar-based parking monitoring application;modified convolutional neural network;smart city applications;radar signals;CNN training;performance improvement;radiation pattern;MIMO array;4-fold cross-validation;deep learning;vacant parking space detection;frequency 77 GHz,,,23,,,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality.

We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party.
