"Novel Approach in IoT-Based Smart Road with Traffic Decongestion Strategy for Smart Cities",2020,"10.1007/978-981-15-0626-0_16","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076994351&doi=10.1007%2f978-981-15-0626-0_16&partnerID=40&md5=207f4bfe038ae5547a98a94e10e89d7f","Real world needs to connect to its virtual world to enable anything with just a switch. Internet of things (IoT) makes it possible by interaction between people, objects, environment and virtual data involved with them. The increase in a number of vehicles on road, accidents and delay of emergency services calls for an effective solution, i.e., smart roads. To make effective smart roads within smart cities, it is necessary to employ advanced technology to handle the issues related to normal roads by collecting all the data related to it, process and analyze it and find an alternate solution to it within a small fraction of time. Video monitoring and surveillance are widely used but require personnel to monitor the situation and analyze it followed by an appropriate decision which is not recommended for real-time situation.Road traffic density information is an important parameter that can be exploited in avoiding traffic congestion. This paper proposes an alternative solution in real-time world where different sensors from roadside unit (RSU) capture traffic congestion information based on the vehicle crossing over the given span of time, transmit to base station where it is collected and perform big data analytics. This information is made available to the user via custom-designed Android application, keeping the user updated with the present scenario of the road he/she shall take. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",

In this paper, based on the diversion requirements of large-scale speciality platform of the human settlement discipline system, artificial method is used to establish evaluation feature items and set up the evaluation system model. Meanwhile, under the condition of the small sample set, the machine learning method is used to train and adjust parameters to form the first edition of speciality potential assessment system combining with the artificial method, which would lay the foundation for the introduction of more courses and samples to upgrade the system in the future, in the hope to construct more accurate and in-depth potential evaluation to guide students with a more effective method. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",

The evaluation model uses the neighborhood rough set to reduce the index of the evaluation index and form the decision table as the input data of the support vector machine algorithm, which reduces the dimension of the sample data and improves the training speed of the evaluation model. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the parameter search of the support vector machine algorithm, which improves the prediction accuracy of the evaluation model.

One of the problem of smart city monitoring such as the flame detection task in real time is considered. The flame as the object of interest is one of the most complex objects tracking. This is due to the lack of time and space invariance in all features of the object of interest. In accordance with this fact, the computational processes are characterized by high computational complexity and latency of program tracking procedures. There are several basic approaches to minimizing computing costs and reducing time delays (shifts). Using the ROI is one of them. Thus, a new model of the hypothesis generator for the effective evaluation of ROI is proposed. The task of the generator is to select the areas that contain a fire in the video stream. In this case, the main criterion for identifying the region is the index of complexitivity. Due to using the proposed model, the classification procedures quality is increased, and as a result, computing costs of the tracking methods is reduced in general. The many experiments based on both benchmarks and real data sets have confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",

People prefer to use private transport rather than public transport which results an increase in the number of vehicles. Thus, finding vacant parking place becomes cumbersome, resulting in several issues like increase in consumption of fuel, time and energy. Thanks to the Internet of things (IOT) that has advanced so much and opened a new spectrum of technologies that were previously considered as science fiction. Almost every field is inclined to get benefits from IOT. Big cities or metropolitan cities are also on the track of smart cities by exploiting IOT and addressing issues such as traffic congestion, limited car parking facilities and road safety. In this paper, we have reviewed some research papers from the recent work carried out in the year 2018 to 2019 related to IOT based smart parking. In their investigations different models augmented with sensors, integrating cloud and mobile application are presented, which subsequently yields in a smart parking system which saves time, energy, fuel and subsequently carbon footprint. It is noticed that disabled people are ignored to be addressed in their systems and there is no single global parking solution exists so far. The rapid development in miniaturization and robustness of processors, sensor and coupling with machine learning added to the potential of smart and single global solution feasible for future researchers to address parking issues exists in both indoor and outdoor parking lots. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",

Unfortunately, deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices presents significant challenges. These workloads are computationally intensive and often require cloud-like resources. Prior solutions attempted to address these challenges by either introducing more design efforts or by relying on cloud resources for assistance. In this paper, we propose a runtime adaptive convolutional neural network (CNN) acceleration framework that is optimized for heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The framework leverages spatial partitioning techniques through fusion of the convolution layers and dynamically selects the optimal degree of parallelism according to the availability of computational resources, as well as network conditions. Our evaluation shows that our framework outperforms state-of-art approaches by improving the inference speed and reducing communication costs while running on wirelessly-connected Raspberry-Pi3 devices. Experimental evaluation shows up to 1.9× ∼ 3.7× speedup using 8 devices for three popular CNN models. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",

SG applications have stringent and unique latency and bandwidth requirements. 4G LTE and the evolving 5G promises to support a wide range of applications in the SG. This research analyses the performance of 4G LTE and 5G networks in supporting big data analytics for SG in developing countries. In order to evaluate the technical practicality of using wireless cellular networks provided by local mobile operators, a comparative analysis of three 4G LTE networks operators on wide area network (WAN) application and an emulated future 5G networks is carried out in Nigeria. The latency (λ), throughput (τ) and packet loss rate (ψ) for the three local networks providers (denoted as OP1, OP2, OP3), and the emulated 5G networks (denoted as EFN1, EFN2, EFN3) were used for the experimentation using OMNET++ simulation tool. The obtained results indicate that OP2 is a better choice for WAN SG applications when the communication radius is below 1600m and OP3 is a preferable choice when communication radius grows up to 2400m and beyond. While on the other hand, the results obtained for the 5G networks show that, on average, EFN2 is a better choice for WAN SG applications when the communication radius is lesser than 1600m and EFN3 is a preferable choice when the communication radius extend beyond 2400m. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",

The need to establish more inclusive and sustainable public transport programs has brought larger cities in Latin America to seek new ways to enhance mobility and integration of transport systems. In this paper, we analyze the level of mobility and integration of public transport systems in eight Latin American cities. For each city we applied the mobility integration index introduced by Cohen [1] and Kamargianni [2] considering key factors including ticket and payment integration, use of information and communication technologies (ICT), institutional integration, clean energy transport and mobility packages. The study indicates that Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City and Buenos Aires have made most advances in implementing a more integrated and mobile public transport system, with S ão Paulo, Santiago de Chile and Curitiba showing an intermediate level of integration and Lima and Bogota struggling to achieve higher levels of mobility. While the study indicates that integrated mobility programs are taking off in Latin America, faster development is limited by multiple factors including a lacking vision on inclusive and sustainable public transport, resistance from transport operators, limitations in ICT infrastructure and limited financial resources to embark on mayor mobility programs in the region. Given that this research is limited to a comparison of Latin American cities and to advance with much needed mobility in the region, it is recommended to conduct further research and derive lessons learned from smart cities with more advanced levels of mobility in public transport in Europe or Asia. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",

Using this as input, we can apply analytics to be able to predict and hopefully prevent crime in the future. In this work, we applied big data analytics to the San Francisco crime dataset, as collected by the San Francisco Police Department and available through the Open Data initiative. The main focus is to perform an in-depth analysis of the major types of crimes that occurred in the city, observe the trend over the years, and determine how various attributes contribute to specific crimes. Furthermore, we leverage the results of the exploratory data analysis to inform the data preprocessing process, prior to training various machine learning models for crime type prediction.

Therefore, rapid locating of faults is the premise for network to recover quickly. However, current faults location methods can't satisfy the requirement due to the expansion scale of wireless and optical networks and the growing demands of customers.

Input features for the classification models are built aggregating packet generation and access collisions from the eNodeB on which failures are being detected, as well as from its closest neighbors, by computing statistics for each time-bin. Given that network service providers generally process real-time data to produce periodic aggregated summaries, we explore the effect of different levels of granularity in data aggregation and their effect on our ability to detect failures. The M2M traffic data was gathered from a simulated LTE network that uses publicly available geographic databases from the city of Montreal. With Linear Support Vector Machines (L-SVMs) and Bagged Decision Trees (BDT), failure detection rates above 97.5 % were achieved, with false positive rates under 2.8 %, showing that, even with 30 minutes aggregations, it is feasible to extract meaningful failure information. © 2019 IEEE.",

The large volume of complex traffic and the uncertainty of market supplies/demands have made it essential for many MOD service providers to proactively dispatch vehicles towards ride-seekers. To meet this need effectively, we propose STRide, an MOD coordination-learning mechanism reinforced spatio-temporally with capsules. We formalize the adaptive coordination of vehicles into a reinforcement learning framework. STRide incorporates spatial and temporal distributions of supplies (vehicles) and demands (ride requests), customers' preferences and other external factors. A novel spatio-temporal capsule neural network is designed to predict the provider's rewards based on MOD network states, vehicles and their dispatch actions. This way, the MOD platform adapts itself to the supply-demand dynamics with the best potential rewards. We have conducted extensive data analytics and experimental evaluation with three large-scale datasets (∼21 million rides from Uber, Yellow Taxis and Didi). STRide is shown to outperform state-of-the-arts, substantially reducing request-rejection rate and passenger waiting time, and also increasing the service provider's profits, often making 30% improvement over state-of-the-arts. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.",

We have implemented an interoperable data platform for smart city to enable Internet of Things (IoT) data exchanges among organizations through APIs. One of the key success is that people can access and visual the data. However, data can have various attributes since standard has not completely established and adopted. Therefore, it is difficult to automate the process to achieve comprehensive visualization. Traditionally, we require developers to manually examine data streams to determine which data attribute should be presented. This process can be very time consuming. The visualization system must be manually updated whenever a source stream modifies its data attributes. This problem becomes an impediment to implement a scalable cloud-based visualization service. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an automated attribute inference approach to automatically select key visualizable attribute from heterogeneous streams of data sources. We have experimented with different data attribute selection algorithms, namely an empirical rule-based system and the chosen machine learning algorithms. We implement and evaluate the proposed selection algorithms through our 3D visualization program in order to get the feedback from users.

Based on the performance of these methods explored in previous studies, recommendations of application are provided for different categories such as building type (e.g., residential), forecasting method (e.g., long-term), and building energy (e.g., electricity). Some of the main identified research gaps include the lack of studies dedicated to long-term energy forecasts and inability to successfully incorporate occupant behavior into the models. This review also highlights the potential and prospects of hybrid models as avenues of growth in the domain of building energy forecast. Further research efforts in these areas of study can reap future benefits by promoting energy conservation thereby reducing the ecological footprint. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

Due to the limited professional manpower and budget, providing a guide concerning potential problematic conditions is important to support on-site bridge inspections. The aim of this study was to estimate the number and severity of damage occurrences on a bridge deck using the Korean bridge management system (KOBMS). In this research, we considered identification, structural, inspection, and environmental factors and developed a deep neural network (DNN) model using 15,309 data, and we determined 36 influencing factors. The DNN model successfully predicted the number of damage occurrences on bridge decks and their severity with about 94.68% accuracy, confirmed by inserting external environmental data and span information. The findings emphasized the benefit of using machine learning algorithms when analyzing bridge conditions, and it showed potential for application to network-level decision making for preventive maintenance. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

Defining storms' severity, though, is challenging due to the high number of weather parameters needed to describe these events and the non-linear relationships among these parameters. Finding patterns among snowstorms can conceivably simplify this process and help practitioners better analyze and prepare for such events, even when the severity is not explicitly quantified. Therefore, this study interrogated historical data to assess and compare clustering methods and to identify patterns manifesting in snowstorms to lay the necessary foundations for building a more reliable and objective winter severity index. The research team selected three hierarchical clustering methods that differentiated similar groups of snowstorms among more than 2,000 events dated between 2006-2016 in Nebraska. The team then evaluated the performance of these methods using the Calinski-Harabasz index. A range of clustering scenarios were reviewed visually using principal component analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters. The results indicate that while some districts can be described by as few as three clusters, others can experience up to six different clusters of snowstorms. The use of PCA and visualization in this context can facilitate a better understanding of these high-dimensional data, and the findings of this study can help agencies better comprehend snowstorms and prepare for them, which can help communities to maintain the safety and mobility of their drivers. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

A case study in dynamic courier dispatching system",2019,,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076890703&partnerID=40&md5=bc1a722a399d067215466ad88dfe7bea","In this paper, wo study a courier dispatching problem (CDP) raised from an online pickup-service platform of Alibaba. The GDP aims to assign a set of couriers to serve pickup requests with stochastic spatial and temporal arrival rate among urban regions. The objective is to maximize the revenue of served requests given a limited number of couriers over a period of time. Many online algorithms such as dynamic matching and vehicle routing strategy from existing literature could be applied to tackle this problem. However, these methods rely on appropriately predefined optimization objectives at each decision point, which is hard in dynamic situations. This paper formulates the CDP as a Markov decision process (MDP) and proposes a data-driven approach to derive the optimal dispatching rule-set under different scenarios. Our method stacks multi-layer images of the spatial-and-temporal map and apply multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques to evolve dispatching models. This method solves the learning inefficiency caused by traditional centralized MDP modeling. Through comprehensive experiments on both artificial dataset and real-world dataset, we show: 1) By utilizing historical data and considering long-term revenue gains, MARL achieves better performance than myopic online algorithms; 2) MARL is able to construct the mapping between complex scenarios to sophisticated decisions such as the dispatching rule. 3) MARL has the scalability to adopt in large-scale real-world scenarios. © 2019 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.

In the last years, driven by increased availability of geo-referenced data from social or embedded sensors and remote sensing (RS) images, various methods become popular for land use analysis. This paper addresses the various methods employed in this context, as well as needed data and respective categorization, best applications of each method, and their comparison. We focus on approaches based on data from RS images, open maps and various categories of crowdsourced data. We identify and discuss the way these approaches use Data Mining (DM) and Machine Learning (ML). From our initial study we concluded that even using the same methods and the same kind of data, results depend on spatial configuration of the data, accordingly to the specificity of each region. The work described in this paper is intended to provide relevant contributions to method selection for knowledge discovery for city planning and management, taking into consideration available data and the pros and cons of each technique.

Different stakeholders have different concerns and needs, and they make different decisions regarding the priorities of implementing disaster resilience strategies given limited resources. These differences are deeply rooted in their value systems, which are defined as ranked systems of things that are of importance, merit, and utility to the stakeholders. The differences in their value system cause conflicts and disputes for disaster-related decision making, which may result in longer decision-making time and huge financial losses. Therefore, there is a need to understand and systemically integrate the value systems of multi-sector stakeholders to support more effective and collaborative decision making in disaster resilience. To address such need, this paper proposes a stakeholder value aggregation (SVA) model to systematically and quantitatively aggregate divergent stakeholder value systems by leveraging a reinforcement learning-based method. The proposed SVA model was illustrated using a case study that focuses on aggregating the value systems of responsible and impacted stakeholders. The paper also discusses our proposed framework for a cloud-based decision support system that allows for automatic aggregation of divergent stakeholder value systems. The model, together with its potential application of cloud-based decision support system will facilitate more collaborative and efficient decision making by identifying the collective value priorities on disaster resilience practices. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",

A useful but relatively low-tech application is counting human presence by using carbon dioxide sensor. Such CO2 sensors are durable and inexpensive, with their compact sizes they could be deployed anywhere for estimating head counts ubiquitously. In this paper, a case study of applying CO2 sensors in public buses is investigated. Counting passengers in public buses or public transport in general has great economics advantages. However, a few technical challenges include but not limited to the mobility of the bus, the dynamic air flows, and factors such as windows were open, ventilation and even urban pollution etc, would affect the accuracy of occupancy counting. Hardly there would be a simple linear mapping between the number of people in a bus and the measurement of CO2 level. Hence, non-linear machine learning tool is used for inferring the non-linear relation between the two, with the consideration of the mentioned influential factors. Empirical data are collected from experiments conducted in several different buses over different times. The results can point to a promising conclusion that satisfactory accuracy could be achieved.

Recently, the IoT became an emerging technology. One of the most significant current research discussion topics on the IoT is about the smart car parking. A modern urban city has over a million of cars on its roads but it does not have enough parking space. Moreover, most of the contemporary researchers propose management of the data on cloud. However, this method may be considered as an issue since the raw data is sent promptly from distributed sensors to the parking area via cloud and then received back after it is processed. This is considered as an expensive technique in terms of the data transmission as well as the energy cost and consumption. While the majority of proposed solutions address the problem of finding unoccupied parking space and ignore some other critical issues such as information about the nearest car parking and the roads traffic congestion, this paper goes beyond and proposes the alternative method. The paper proposes a smart car parking system that will assist users to solve the issue of finding a parking space and to minimise the time spent in searching for the nearest available car park. In addition, it provides users with roads traffic congestion status.

However, easy access to these new radio technologies brings a security problem due to the fact that it is very easy for a malicious user to perform passive wireless signal scanning on these networks and use this information to launch identity-based attacks. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning based strategy to detect spoofing attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Based on detailed analytical models for the mobile radio channel, the proposed algorithm combines two classifiers to process and analyze the instant samples of received signal strength to detect attacks. The algorithm is optimized for scenarios where the legitimate node and the attacking node are at the same distance or at a very close distance from each other in relation to the landmark, what is the worst case scenario. The results show that the proposed strategy improves the performance of the attack detection in about 10% regarding a similar approach in the literature. © 2018 IEEE.",

These cities are looking to apply the smart city concept to improve sustainability, quality of life for residents, and economic development. The smart city concept depends on employing a wide range of advanced technologies to improve the performance of various services and activities such as transportation, energy, healthcare, and education, while at the same time improve the city's resources utilization and initiate new business opportunities. One of the promising technologies to support such efforts is the big data technology. Effective and intelligent use of big data accumulated over time in various sectors can offer many advantages to enhance decision making in smart cities. In this paper we identify the different types of decision making processes involved in smart cities. Then we propose a service-oriented architecture to support big data analytics for decision making in smart cities. This architecture allows for integrating different technologies such as fog and cloud computing to support different types of analytics and decision-making operations needed to effectively utilize available big data.

Although IoT brings significant advantages over traditional information and communication (ICT) technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), these applications are still very rare. Although there is a continuous improvement in road and vehicle safety, as well as improvements in IoT, the road traffic accidents have been increasing over the last decades. Therefore, it is necessary to find an effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of traffic accidents. Hence, this paper presents an intelligent traffic accident detection system in which vehicles exchange their microscopic vehicle variables with each other. The proposed system uses simulated data collected from vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) based on the speeds and coordinates of the vehicles and then, it sends traffic alerts to the drivers. Furthermore, it shows how machine learning methods can be exploited to detect accidents on freeways in ITS. It is shown that if position and velocity values of every vehicle are given, vehicles' behavior could be analyzed and accidents can be detected easily. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forests (RF) are implemented on traffic data to develop a model to distinguish accident cases from normal cases. The performance of RF algorithm, in terms of its accuracy, was found superior to ANN and SVM algorithms. RF algorithm has showed better performance with 91.56% accuracy than SVM with 88.71% and ANN with 90.02% accuracy. © 2018 IEEE.",

Despite its benefits, the ubiquity of social network services introduces vulnerabilities to malicious behavior such as Sybil attacks or identity theft. As the 5G Era leads to the convergence of social, wireless, and mobile networks by enabling synergistic interplay between these networks, it is possible to take advantage of mobile edge computing in the detection of compromised social profiles in mobile and online social network platforms. In this paper, we propose a framework for participatory detection of identity theft on social networking platforms which would exploit the computing power of the user equipment. The proposed framework empowers the connections of a user in a social platform to cooperate on the verification of a social profile. Through a proof-of-concept study, we show that the proposed framework can detect anomalous behavior in the social profile by having each connection work on a different feature subset without semantic analysis.

Commercial, industrial and residential buildings often incorporate systems used to determine occupancy. However, relatively simple sensor technology and control algorithms limit the effectiveness of smart building services. In this paper we propose to replace sensor technology with time series models that can predict the number of occupants at a given location and time. We use Wi-Fi datasets readily available in abundance for smart building services and train Auto Regression Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) time series models. As a use case scenario of smart building services, these models allow forecasting of the number of people at a given time and location in 15, 30 and 60 minutes time intervals at building as well as Access Point (AP) level.

Our experiments show that LSTM combined model reduced the computational resources with respect to the number of neurons by 74.48 % for the AP level, and by 67.13 % for the building level. Further, the root mean square error (RMSE) was reduced by 88.2%-93.4% for LSTM in comparison to ARIMA for the building levels models and by 80.9 %-87% for the AP level models. © 2017 IEEE.",

Therefore, our objective in this work is to propose a spectral clustering-based approach for sentiment classification in Modern Standard Arabic. This class of graph-based algorithms has been widely successful due to its high performance in many contexts where several classical techniques fail. In fact, on the basis of the experiments we conducted on a dataset collected from Goodreads, it was found out that is this approach can automatically extract and identify the polarity of a given text and can, thus, reach higher accuracy compared to other machine learning algorithms. Results of the study have, actually, proven that our approach out performs K-means algorithms by achieving an accuracy rate of 83.13%. © 2018 CURRAN-CONFERENCE. All rights reserved.",

A hybrid text mining techniques such as machine learning, rule-based algorithm, and heuristics are used to identify the text of technical field section. The most significant technical areas are extracted by applying scalable analytics service that involves natural language processing techniques. Community detection approaches are applied for efficiently aggregating terms of technical areas into communities/topics based on a network graph. Our methods are built on top of big-data architecture to deal with large-scale of patent texts. A comparison to the standard LDA clustering is presented, and the results show that our methods do not share common terms and perform well with real applications. © 2018 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

The generative processes of these event data can be very complex, requiring flexible models to capture their dynamics. Temporal point processes offer an elegant framework for modeling event data without discretizing the time. However, the existing maximum-likelihood-estimation (MLE) learning paradigm requires hand-crafting the intensity function beforehand and cannot directly monitor the goodness-of-fit of the estimated model in the process of training. To alleviate the risk of model-misspecification in MLE, we propose to generate samples from the generative model and monitor the quality of the samples in the process of training until the samples and the real data are indistinguishable. We take inspiration from reinforcement learning (RL) and treat the generation of each event as the action taken by a stochastic policy. We parameterize the policy as a flexible recurrent neural network and gradually improve the policy to mimic the observed event distribution. Since the reward function is unknown in this setting, we uncover an analytic and nonparametric form of the reward function using an inverse reinforcement learning formulation. This new RL framework allows us to derive an efficient policy gradient algorithm for learning flexible point process models, and we show that it performs well in both synthetic and real data. © 2018 Curran Associates Inc.All rights reserved.",

IoT has become an active area of research, since IoT promises among other to improve quality of live and safety in Smart Cities, to make resource supply and waste management more efficient, and optimize traffic. DM is highly domain specific and depends on what is being mined for. For instance, if IoT is used to optimize traffic in a Smart City to reduce traffic jams and to find parking spaces quicker, different types of data needs to be collected and analysed from an eHealth solution, where IoT is used in a Smart Home to monitor the well being of patients or elderly people. IoT connects things that can collect numeric data from smart sensors, streaming data from cameras or route information on maps. Depending on the type of data, different techniques need to be adopted to analyse them. Also, many IoT applications analyse data from different devices and correlate them to make predictions about possible machine failures in production sites or looming emergency situations in Smart Buildings in a home security application. DM techniques need to handle the heterogeneity of IoT data, the large volumes of data and the speed at which they are produced.

However, data streams produced from distributed sensing devices may not suffice to be processed traditionally in the remote cloud due to: (i) longer Wide Area Network (WAN) latencies and (ii) limited resources held by a single Cloud. To solve this problem, a novel Software-Defined Network (SDN) based InterCloud architecture is presented for mobile edge computing environments, known as EdgeIoT. An adaptive resource capacity management approach is proposed to employ a policy-based QoS control framework using principles in coalition games with externalities. To optimise resource capacity policy, the proposed QoS management technique solves, adaptively, a lexicographic ordering bi-criteria Coalition Structure Generation (CSG) problem. It is an onerous task to guarantee in a deterministic way that a real-time EdgeIoT application satisfies low latency requirement specified in Service Level Agreements (SLA). CloudSim 4.0 toolkit is used to simulate an SDN-based InterCloud scenario, and the empirical results suggest that the proposed approach can adapt, from an operational perspective, to ensure low latency QoS for real-time EdgeIoT application instances. © 2017 IEEE.",

The performance of the algorithms was assessed in terms of accuracy, trustworthy and speed. The data sets were provided by Transport for London (TfL) and the UK MetOffice. We employed a random sample of some 1,800,000 instances, comprising six individual datasets, which we analysed on the WEKA platform. The results revealed that there were a high degree of correlations between weather-based attributes and the Big Data being analysed. Notable observations were that, on average, the decision tree J48 algorithm performed best in terms of accuracy while the kNN IBK algorithm was the fastest to build models.

A basic definition of rural-urban linkages is that they consist of flows (of goods, people, information, finance, waste, information, social relations) across space, linking rural and urban areas (Cecilia, 2015). Economically, rural and urban areas are linked by the reciprocal exchange of unprocessed and processed products, with both areas acting as mutually reinforcing markets [1]. Perhaps a less descriptive definition is of the functional links between sectors (agriculture, industry, and services). The latter is central to structural change taking place in both rural and urban areas. Additionally, rural and urban economies exhibit symbiotic relationship. Cecilia [2] notes 'in many regions of the world we are witnessing an increase in production, especially of perishable and high-value products such as fruit, vegetables and dairy, responding to urban demand'. This is especially the case in rural areas that are well connected to urban markets by transport links, communications and electricity, and by networks of local traders (Cecilia, 2015). This is especially true with Dairy Industry. The dairy industry exhibits mini ecosystem of rural and urban linkage. The dairy industry plays an important role for both rural and urban dwellers: a) a major source of rural employment (12% to 14% of world population [6]), b) consistent non-seasonal source of income with immediate cash returns, c) major urban consumer staple and d) major contributor of agriculture GDP in developing countries. In many developing countries, dairy industry employees majority of workforce from rural and have direct influence on rural and urban commerce. As per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [3], 'more than 6 billion people worldwide consume milk and milk products, the majority of these people live in developing countries' [2]. It's clear from the above, urban and rural areas have symbiotic relationship and in order to make urban areas smart, aka Smart Cities, it is imperative that the linkage of urban, in this case rural areas, needs be Smart entities, aka. Smart Villages. For making Smart Village, according to Viswanadham [7] 'the existing infrastructure and services (such as Power, Water, Buildings, Retail, Health care, etc.) need to be upgraded and in building the new ones. This requires standardization, use of IT and sensor networks'. In this research paper, we propose innovative approach to develop dairy IoT sensor network that enables Smart dairy, making Smart Villages a reality. We offer development of Smart Dairy IoT Sensors that not only identify cattle related health issues but also enable data and information sharing with dairy farmers for better predicting milk production and improvement of productivity. In addition, the data collected from IoT sensor and analytics models play pivotal role in preventing spread of viral flus and cattle health issues. Finally, the data collected from our IoT Dairy sensors and analytics will enable digital transformation at village level thus enabling cities smarter.

So, there is a need for visual big data analytics which involves processing and analyzing large scale visual data such as images or videos to find semantic patterns that are useful for interpretation.

With the application of Apache Spark more and more widely, some problems are exposed. One of the most important aspects is the performance problem. Apache Spark has more than 180 configuration parameters, which can be adjusted by users according to their own specific application so as to optimize the performance. Currently these parameters are tuned manually by trial and error, which is ineffective due to the large parameter space and the complex interactions among the parameters. In this paper, in order to make the parameter tuning process of Spark more effective, a novel method for tuning configuration of Spark based on machine learning is proposed, which is composed of binary classification and multi-classification. This method can be used to auto-tune the configuration parameters of Spark. Furthermore, several common machine learning algorithms based on the proposed method are explored, and experimental results show that decision tree model (C5.0) is the best model considering the accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, the experimental results also show that the performance can get average 36% gain with the proposed method compared with the default configuration of Spark. © 2016 IEEE.",

Machine learning has been successfully introduced into SpMT to improve its performance. An appropriate sample set is important for machine learning-based (ML-based) thread partition. Conventionally, heuristic rules-based (HR-based) sample generation approach can not generate adaptive samples, which conform to ML-based thread partition platform and characteristics of source applications. A hybrid sample generation approach is proposed. With this method, we firstly automatically generate samples which are mips codes consisting spawning points (SP) and control quasi-independent points (CQIP) by heuristic rules, then manually adjust the positions of SP and CQIP and rebuild pre-computation slice (p-slice) to obtain better performance for every application. During the implementation of this approach, three measures: bias weighting, reservation of optimal solutions, summary of greedy rules are carried out. In this way, we enhance the adjustment frequency for the subroutine with high called number, achieving a stable improvement of speedups. On Prophet, which is a generic SpMT processor to evaluate the performance of multithreaded programs, Olden benchmarks are used to realize the approach. Experiments show that the approach can obtain better sample sets, which deliver a better performance improvement of about 10% on a 32 core than conventional heuristic-based approach. Experiments also prove that this approach is effective to get sample sets for ML-based thread partition methods. © 2016 IEEE.",

Although data-parallel ML systems often engage a perfect error tolerance when synchronizing the model parameters for maximizing parallelism, the synchronization of model parameters may delay in completion, a problem that generally gets worse at a large scale. This paper presents a Bounded Asynchronous Parallel (BAP) model of computation that allows computations using stale model parameters in order to reduce synchronization overheads. In the meanwhile, our BAP model ensures theoretical convergence guarantees for large scale data-parallel ML applications. This model permits distributed workers to use the stale parameters storing in the local cache, instead of waiting until the Parameter Server (PS) produces a new version. This expressively reduces the time workers spend on waiting. Furthermore, the BAP model guarantees the convergence of ML algorithm by bounding the maximum distance of the stale parameters. Experiments conducted on 4 cluster nodes with up to 32 GPUs showed that our model significantly improved the proportion of computing time relative to the waiting time and led to 1.2-2×speedup. Besides, we elaborated how to choose the staleness threshold when considering the tradeoff between Efficiency and Speed. © 2016 IEEE.",

The aim of this application is to reduce the threat risk of the physical integrity of pedestrians by geolocating, in real-Time, safer places to walk. In this context for a city, San Isidro, a business district of Lima, has been established as study case. The district has been divided into map sectors and subsectors, so that by using the GPS location service integrated in mobile devices, it is possible to identify areas that have the highest incidence of different types of incidents. This functionality will allow users to choose safer routes by taking into account the information provided for each sector. The data used in this application has been obtained from an Open Data platform managed by the San Isidro municipality. In this application, we have processed the data enabling the easy and friendly access to the information by the end user. The importance of this work is how we have used the machine learning algorithm for incident rates in real and future time, trying to make predictions that can not only provide safe routes to users, but also predict disasters and allow public authorities to act in advance, thus minimizing the impact of future incidents. © 2016 IEEE.",

An urban design problem is viewed as a multiple-criteria optimization problem. The outlined feature of an urban design problem is the dependence of a design goal on a context of the problem. We model the design goal as a randomized fitness measure that depends on the context. In terms of multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), the defined measure corresponds to a subjective expected utility of a user. In the first stage of the proposed approach we let the algorithm explore a design space using clustering techniques. The second stage is an interactive design loop; the user makes a proposal, then the program optimizes it, gets the user's feedback and returns back the control over the application interface.",

Unlike traditional multi-core desktops, mobile devices are restricted by the limited energy the batteries can buffer. It remains unclear whether it is energy efficient to adopt heterogeneous computing in multi-core mobile devices. In this paper, we evaluate mobile heterogeneous computing by benchmarking RenderScript, a high performance computing framework in Android system, using 6 selected benchmarks in the area of linear algebra, machine learning and image processing. For each benchmark, both the original version and the RenderScript heterogeneous version are implemented for the performance comparison. We make a thorough study of the performance in terms of computation speedup and power consumption on two smart phone platforms. Our results demonstrate that, compared with original implementation, the increase of computation speed ranges from 2 to 18 by using RenderScript while the power consumption overhead is capped by 75%. By adopting heterogeneous computing, the total energy required for executing the applications can be significantly reduced. Based on the benchmarking results, the potential for improving energy efficiency of multi-core mobile devices is discussed. © 2015 IEEE.",

We believe RL is an ideal approach since this task falls under the control-optimization problem where RL has yielded optimal results in previous work. The magnitude and scale of a DH system complexity incurs the curse of dimensionalities and model, hereby making RL a good choice since it provides a solution for the problem. To assist RL even further with the curse of dimensionalities, we intend to investigate the use of SL to reduce the state space. To achieve this, we shall use historical data to generate a heat load sub-model for each home. We believe using the output of these sub-models as feedback to the RL algorithm could significantly reduce the complexity of the learning task. Also, it could reduce convergence time for the RL algorithm. The desired goal is to achieve a realtime application, which takes operational actions when it receives new direct feedback. However, considering the dynamics of DH system such as large time delay and dissipation in DH network due to various factors, we hope to investigate things such as the appropriate data sampling rate and new parameters / sensors that could improve knowledge about the state of the system, especially on the consumer side of the DH network. © 2014 IEEE.",
