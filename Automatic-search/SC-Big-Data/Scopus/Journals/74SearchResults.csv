"Integrating complex event processing and machine learning: An intelligent architecture for detecting IoT security attacks",2020,"10.1016/j.eswa.2020.113251","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079340111&doi=10.1016%2fj.eswa.2020.113251&partnerID=40&md5=43a93e58809b1a17db000345efc6d7ae","The Internet of Things (IoT) is growing globally at a fast pace: people now find themselves surrounded by a variety of IoT devices such as smartphones and wearables in their everyday lives. Additionally, smart environments, such as smart healthcare systems, smart industries and smart cities, benefit from sensors and actuators interconnected through the IoT. However, the increase in IoT devices has brought with it the challenge of promptly detecting and combating the cybersecurity attacks and threats that target them, including malware, privacy breaches and denial of service attacks, among others. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes an intelligent architecture that integrates Complex Event Processing (CEP) technology and the Machine Learning (ML) paradigm in order to detect different types of IoT security attacks in real time. In particular, such an architecture is capable of easily managing event patterns whose conditions depend on values obtained by ML algorithms. Additionally, a model-driven graphical tool for security attack pattern definition and automatic code generation is provided, hiding all the complexity derived from implementation details from domain experts. The proposed architecture has been applied in the case of a healthcare IoT network to validate its ability to detect attacks made by malicious devices. The results obtained demonstrate that this architecture satisfactorily fulfils its objectives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",

In this context, finding an unoccupied parking slot by the interested vehicle owners with least overhead becomes an NP-Hard problem bounded by various constraints. In-advance availability of information regarding parking occupancy plays a major role in hassle free trip optimization for motorists. It also facilitates services-cum-profit management for the parking owners. It further helps in curbing congestion by reducing cruising time and hence, helps in controlling pollution of the smart cities. Thus, accurate and timely information regarding parking occupancy and availability has become the basic need in the evolution of the smart cities. Motivated by these facts, an occupancy-driven machine learning based on-street parking pricing scheme is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme uses machine learning based approaches to predict occupancy of parking lots, which in turn is used to deduce occupancy driven prices for arriving vehicles. In order to train, test, and compare different machine learning models, on-street parking data of Seattle city has been used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that parking occupancy prediction system is used to generate occupancy based parking prices for on-street parking system of the Seattle city. Results obtained using the proposed occupancy driven machine learning based on-street parking pricing scheme demonstrate its effectiveness over other existing state-of-the-art schemes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",

In this paper, the Supervisory controller and data acquirement (SCADA) Approach for sustainable water management in the smart city based on IoT and Big Data Analytics. Big data analysis is a new technical term for the collection from deployed IoT sensors of huge amounts of relevant data to track the physical state, use and quality of the device. The Internet of Things (IoT) software can be extended to the entire water supply system and to device product use to carry out this principle of big data analysis.

Often, these IoT applications fall in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), e.g., autonomous robot navigation in smart factories and traffic signal control in smart cities. However, RL-based applications require a long learning time. To overcome this limitation and scale with the number of agents, parallel RL (PRL) algorithms run multiple RL agents in parallel and on distributed environments. However, deploying PRL algorithms in such environments entails a communication overhead that increases the (actual) execution time. The state-of-the-art PRL algorithms are designed for reducing the learning time while assuming no (or limited) communication overhead. In this article, we present a novel partitioning algorithm that minimizes the communication overhead in PRL running on IoT environments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses on solving the communication overhead of distributing PRL algorithms without requiring any a priori knowledge about the structure of the problem. The proposed algorithm intelligently combines a dynamic state partitioning strategy, which exploits the agent's exploration capabilities to build partition knowledge while learning, with an efficient mapping of agents to partitions, which reduces the communication among agents. Performance evaluations show that the proposed algorithm can achieve almost no communication among PRL agents at the converged state. © 2014 IEEE.",

Accurate and efficient congested link identification has become a foundational issue to IoT applications like self-driving cars, digital health, smart city, and so on. However, directly monitoring the massive number of interior links often introduces high operation cost or even is infeasible in practice, giving rise to indirect monitoring techniques like network Boolean tomography. Nevertheless, in many networks, the number of their interior links is larger than their end-to-end paths, making it very challenging for network Boolean tomography to find a determined solution. To resolve this issue, most of current methods try to utilize some prerequisites, such as the link congestion probabilities. While these probabilities might be hard or even unable to be obtained accurately in dynamical networks, limiting the practical deployment. In this paper, we are motivated to design a framework of congested link identification without any prerequisite or assumption. We first novelly model the congested link identification procedures as a Markov decision processes (MDPs), and then employ a reinforcement learning technology, i.e., Q -learning, to solve this MDP. The simulation results show that our proposed scheme can autonomously and efficiently explore the unknown network environment, and is able to achieve better adaptivity and correctness, without any prior knowledge comparing to existing methods. © 2014 IEEE.",

This study presents an intelligent data mining methodology as part of an expert system developed for SHM with noisy and delayed signals, which are generated by a through-substrate self-powered sensor network. The noted sensor network has been demonstrated as an effective means for minimizing energy consumption in WSNs for SHM. Experimental vibration tests were conducted on a cantilever plate to evaluate the developed expert system for SHM. The proposed data mining method is based on the integration of pattern recognition, an innovative probabilistic approach, and machine learning. The novelty of the proposed system for SHM with data interpretation methodology lies in the integration of the noted intelligent techniques on discrete, binary, noisy, and delayed patterns of signals collected from self-powered sensing technology in the application to a practical engineering problem, i.e., data-driven energy-efficient SHM. Results confirm that the proposed data mining method employing a probabilistic approach can be effectively used to reconstruct delayed and missing signals, thereby addressing the important issue of energy availability for intelligent SHM systems being used for damage identification in civil and aerospace structures. The applicability and effectiveness of the expert system with the data mining approach in detecting damage with noisy signals was demonstrated for plate-like structures with an accuracy of 97%.

Motion tracking is important for smart services and location-based services in smart cities, since it provides natural ways for users to interact with the IoT infrastructures, such as the ability to recognize of a wide range of hand motion in real-time. Compared with dedicated hardware devices, ubiquitous devices with reliable speakers and microphones can be developed to achieve cheap acoustic-based motion tracking, which is appropriate for low-power and low-cost IoT applications. However, for complex urban environments, it is very difficult for acoustic-based methods to achieve accurate motion tracking due to multipath fading and limited sampling rate at mobile devices. In this paper, a new parameter called multipath dispersion vector (MDV) is proposed to estimate and mitigate the impact of multipath fading on received signals using extreme learning machine. Based on MDV, a robust acoustic motion tracking (RAMTEL) method is proposed to calculate the moving distance based on the phase change of acoustic signals, and track the corresponding motion in 2-D plane by using multiple speakers. The method is then proposed and implemented on standard Android smartphones. Experiment results show, without any specialized hardware, RAMTEL can achieve an impressive millimeter-level accuracy for localization and motion tracking applications in multipath fading environments. Specifically, the measurement errors are less than 2 and 4 mm in 1-D and 2-D scenarios, respectively. © 2014 IEEE.",

Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts. Extensive experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme. © 2014 IEEE.",

However, IoT suffers from a lack of interoperability leading to a substantial threat to the predicted economic value. Schema.org provides semantic interoperability to structure heterogeneous data on the Web. An extension of this vocabulary for the IoT domain (iot.schema.org) is an ongoing research effort to address semantic interoperability for the Web of Things (WoT). To design this vocabulary, a central challenge is to identify the main topics (concepts and properties) automatically from existing knowledge in IoT applications. We designed knowledge extraction for the WoT (KE4WoT) to automatically identify the most important topics from literature ontologies of three different IoT application domains: 1) smart home; 2) smart city; and 3) smart weather - based on our corpus consisting of 4500 full-text conference and journal articles to utilize domain-specific knowledge encoded within IoT publications. Despite the importance of automatically identifying the relevant topics for iot.schema.org, up to know there is no study dealing with this issue. To evaluate the extracted topics, we compare the descriptiveness of these topics for the ten most popular ontologies in the three domains with empirical evaluations of 23 domain experts. The results illustrate that the identified main topics of IoT ontologies can be used to sufficiently describe existing ontologies as keywords. © 2014 IEEE.",

Each layer is designed in a way to process and manage data in a well-organized format. Similarly, the data is tested through Hadoop and Spark in the data processing layer. The data is disseminated to a smart community citizen using the proposed event and decision mechanism based on named data networking. The proposed system is tested for transportation datasets from various authentic sources. The results show processing of data and real-time dissemination with citizens in less possible time.

IoT offers different types of applications, such as, but not limited to, smart traffic monitoring, smart home, smart health care and smart cities, to name a few. In a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), computing elements coordinate and communicate with sensor devices, which monitor cyber and physical indicators, and actuators, and also modify the cyber and physical environment where they run. The synergy of computational as well as physical components, specifically the use of CPSs, led to the advancement of IoT implementations. In a cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment, a cloud-based platform is used to store the data generated by IoT devices (normally by sensor devices) which further can be considered as a big data warehouse. This environment is highly scalable and provides important real-time event processing (for example, in critical scenarios like surveillance and monitoring of an industrial plant). In IoT-based critical applications, the real-time data access is obligatory as and when it is required. Such access is possible if we permit only authorized external users to access the real-time data directly from the IoT sensors. Sometimes authorized user may also request for big data query processing and big data analytics over the data stored in cloud servers to figure out hidden patterns of some phenomena (i.e., chances of fire in an industrial plant in future). Therefore, we need secure authentication schemes for cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment in which a legitimate user and an IoT sensor can mutually authenticate each other and establish a common session key for secure communication.

Smart vehicles have played a significant role in the advancement of intelligent and connected transportation systems. Continuous vehicular cloud service availability in smart cities is becoming a crucial subscriber necessity which requires improvement in the vehicular service management architecture. Moreover, as smart cities continue to deploy diversified technologies to achieve assorted and high-performance cloud services, security issues with regards to communicating entities which share personal requester information still prevails. To mitigate these concerns, we introduce an automated secure continuous cloud service availability framework for smart connected vehicles that enables an intrusion detection mechanism against security attacks and provides services that meet users’ quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) requirements. Continuous service availability is achieved by clustering smart vehicles into service-specific clusters. Cluster heads are selected for communication purposes with trusted third-party entities (TTPs) acting as mediators between service requesters and providers. The most optimal services are then delivered from the selected service providers to the requesters. Furthermore, intrusion detection is accomplished through a three-phase data traffic analysis, reduction, and classification technique used to identify positive trusted service requests against false requests that may occur during intrusion attacks. The solution adopts deep belief and decision tree machine learning mechanisms used for data reduction and classification purposes, respectively. The framework is validated through simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in terms of intrusion attack detection.

The positions required from single target to multi-targets become a further increasing difficulty for device-free localization. In order to satisfy the practical localizing application in smart city, an efficient multi-target device-free localization method is proposed based on a sparse coding model.

In other words, IoT is the driving force behind home automation, smart cities, modern health systems, and advanced manufacturing. This also increases the likelihood of cyber threats against IoT devices and services. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in application protocols, including Domain Name System (DNS), Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) that interact directly with backend database systems and client-server applications to store data of IoT services. Successful exploitation of one or more of these protocols can result in data leakage and security breaches. In this paper, an ensemble intrusion detection technique is proposed to mitigate malicious events, in particular botnet attacks against DNS, HTTP, and MQTT protocols utilized in IoT networks. New statistical flow features are generated from the protocols based on an analysis of their potential properties. Then, an AdaBoost ensemble learning method is developed using three machine learning techniques, namely decision tree, Naive Bayes (NB), and artificial neural network, to evaluate the effect of these features and detect malicious events effectively. The UNSW-NB15 and NIMS botnet datasets with simulated IoT sensors' data are used to extract the proposed features and evaluate the ensemble technique. The experimental results show that the proposed features have the potential characteristics of normal and malicious activity using the correntropy and correlation coefficient measures. Moreover, the proposed ensemble technique provides a higher detection rate and a lower false positive rate compared with each classification technique included in the framework and three other state-of-the-art techniques. © 2014 IEEE.",

In the IoMT, the devices, e.g., Multimedia Sensor Nodes (MSNs), are capable of generating both multimedia and non-multimedia data. The generated data are forwarded to a cloud server via a Base Station (BS). However, it is possible that the Internet connection between the BS and the cloud server may be temporarily down. The limited computational resources restrict the MSNs from holding the captured data for a longer time. In this situation, mobile sinks can be utilized to collect data from MSNs and upload to the cloud server. However, this data collection may create privacy issues, such as revealing identities and location information of MSNs. Therefore, there is a need to preserve the privacy of MSNs during mobile data collection. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving-based data collection and analysis (P2DCA) framework for IoMT applications. The proposed framework partitions an underlying wireless multimedia sensor network into multiple clusters. Each cluster is represented by a Cluster Head (CH). The CHs are responsible to protect the privacy of member MSNs through data and location coordinates aggregation. Later, the aggregated multimedia data are analyzed on the cloud server using a counter-propagation artificial neural network to extract meaningful information through segmentation.

However, they are limited with fixed carrying capacity, and thus, MT's energy resource and sensing range are constrained. It is quite challenging to navigate a group of MTs to move around a target area to maximize their total amount of collected data with the limited energy reserve, while geographical fairness among those point-of-interests (PoIs) should also be maximized. It is even more challenging if fully distributed execution is enforced, where no central control is allowed at the backend.

Although indoor localization plays a pivotal role in making the environment smarter, it is still very difficult to compare state-of-the-art localization algorithms due to the scarcity of standard databases. Publicly available databases are neither fine-grained nor contain data for different conditions. Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of Wi-Fi signals vary with indoor environment (open/closed room, presence/absence of user, temperature etc.) and scanning smart hand-held devices. Thus, localization accuracy varies with various environmental conditions and also granularity of location points (cell). Consequently, in this paper, our contribution is two-fold. First, we present a comprehensive indoor localization dataset, subject to different domains-spatial, temporal, context and device. RSSI data has been collected with cell sizes as small as 1m×1m from three floors of a building of our University using an Android application built for this purpose. This multi-floor dataset is available online at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_z1qhoRIcpineP9AHkfVGCfB2Fd_e-fD.

Single classifier cannot easily be modified to suit these variations without loosing its generality. So, to overcome these conditional dependencies, our second contribution is to propose a framework for indoor localization, JUIndoorLoc and design an ensemble of condition specific classifiers as part of the framework to take care of context and device heterogeneity. Consequently, this ensemble of condition specific classifiers is implemented and found to predict a location with 91.74 % accuracy (1.87 m) for our dataset. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",

AVs are envisaged to evolve to a service rather than a product in the future. To provide best user experience of such services, three primary factors, namely, waiting time, travel time, and supply of AV services, are taken into consideration in a multiobjective optimization. Conventional optimization of services relies on traffic flow analysis over a queuing network model. However, due to the mobility of vehicles and the transfer uncertainty of road networks, the queuing network analysis is too complicated and practically intractable. For accuracy and convenient processing, network calculus (NC) is extended to model the queueing problem in this paper. The optimal number of available AVs can be identified by guaranteeing the waiting time of customers. The satisfaction of AV services can be viewed as a supply and demand problem, and optimized by bipartite graph matching. In order to reduce the average travel time, especially for rush hours with heavy traffic, we further propose a new online AVs fleet management scheme with congestion control for smart cities. It is shown that the intelligent management of AV fleet can be efficiently achieved, outperforming the cases of traditional vehicles.

One of the important components of smart cities, ITS, has led to many applications, including surveillance, infotainment, real-time traffic monitoring, and so on. However, its security, performance, and availability are major concerns facing the research community. The existing solutions, such as cellular networks, RSUs, and mobile cloud computing, are far from perfect because these are highly dependent on centralized architecture and bear the cost of additional infrastructure deployment. Also, the conventional methods of data processing are not capable of handling dynamic and scalable data efficiently. To mitigate these issues, this article proposes an advanced vehicular communication technique where RSUs are proposed to be replaced by edge computing platforms. Then secure V2V and V2E communication is designed using the Quotient filter, a probabilistic data structure. In summary, a smart security framework for VANETs equipped with edge computing nodes and 5G technology has been designed to enhance the capabilities of communication and computation in the modern smart city environment. It has been experimentally demonstrated that use of edge nodes as an intermediate interface between vehicle and cloud reduces access latency and avoids congestion in the backbone network, which allows quick decisions to be made based on the traffic scenario in the geographical location of the vehicles.

The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",

However, classic data analysis or machine learning tools ignore some unique characteristics of the multistream measurement data, in particular, the coexistence of strong temporal correlation and interstream relatedness. To this end, in this paper we discuss the problem of novelty detection with multiple coevolving time series data. To capture both the temporal dependence and the interseries relatedness, a multitask nonparametric model is proposed, which can be extended to family of data distributions by adopting the notion of Bregman divergence. Albeit convex, the learning problem can be hard as the time series accumulate. In this regard, an efficient randomized block coordinate descent algorithm is proposed. The model and the algorithm is tested with a real-world application, involving novelty detection and event analysis in smart city power distribution networks with high-resolution multistream measurements. It is shown that the incorporation of interseries relatedness enables the detection of system-level events, which would otherwise be unobservable with traditional methods. The experimental results not only justify the benefits of incorporating information from different sources, but also demonstrate the potential of the proposed multistream analysis tool as one of the core computational components to improve smart city observability, security, and reliability. © 1982-2012 IEEE.",

Crowdsensing approaches for road surface conditions monitoring can benefit smart city road information services. Deteriorated roads induce vehicle damage, traffic congestion, and driver discomfort which influence traffic management. In this paper, we propose a framework for monitoring road surface anomalies. We analyze the common road surface types and irregularities as well as their impact on vehicle motion. In addition to the traditional use of sensors available in smart devices, we utilize the vehicle motion sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) presently available in most land vehicles. Various land vehicles were used in this paper, spanning different sizes, and year model for extensive road experiments. These trajectories were used to collect and build multiple labeled data sets that were used in the system structure. In order to enhance the performance of the sensor measurements, wavelet packet de-noising is used in this paper to enable efficient classification of road surface anomalies. We adopt statistical, time domain, and frequency domain features to distinguish different road anomalies. The descriptive data sets collected in this paper are used to build, train, and test a system classifier through machine learning techniques to detect and categorize multiple road anomalies with different severity levels. Furthermore, we analyze and assess the capabilities of the smart devices and the other vehicle motion sensors to accurately geo-reference the road surface anomalies. Several road test experiments examine the benefits and assess the performance of the proposed architecture. © 2014 IEEE.",

It is known that thousands of zero-day attacks are continuously emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known cyber-attacks. This indicates that even advanced mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that attacks are discriminated from benign traffic. This research is aimed at adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the centralized detection system. The experiments have shown that our distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that the deep model is more effective in attack detection than its shallow counter parts. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",

In this paper, we address the traffic analysis attack to smart homes, where adversaries intercept the Internet traffic from/to the smart home gateway and profile residents' behaviors through digital traces. Traditional cryptographic tools may not work well due to the effectiveness of adversaries' machine learning algorithms in classifying encrypted traffic, so here we propose a privacy-preserving traffic obfuscation framework to achieve the goal.

The design jointly considers the network energy consumption and the resource constraints in IoT devices, while achieving strong differential privacy guarantee so that adversaries cannot link any traffic flow to a specific smart home. Besides, we consider a hostile smart community network and develop secure multihop routing protocols to guarantee the source/destination unlinkability and satisfy each user's personalized privacy requirement.

Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-Time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data.

To address this issue, we propose an advanced methodology for deploying and monitoring the compliance of trusted access control policies. Our proposal extends the traditional life cycle of access control policies with pertinent activities. It integrates formal and semiformal techniques allowing the specification, the verification, the implementation, the reverse-engineering, the validation, the risk assessment, and the optimization of access control policies. To automate and facilitate the practice of our methodology, we introduce our system SVIRVRO that allows managing the extended life cycle of access control policies. We refer to an illustrative example to highlight the relevance of our contributions. © 2018 Faouzi Jaïdi et al.",Open Access

Although developing more sophisticated map-matching algorithms for vehicle and pedestrian navigation systems have been the focus of research in this field, reusability of the historical information already provided by map-matching algorithms has not been addressed yet. In other words, although researchers have been attempting to improve the accuracy of the aforementioned vector to correctly project GPS points on the transportation network, no research has exploited the spatial-temporal pattern in the arrangement of these projection vectors. This pattern, if properly detected, can be used as a rough surrogate for map-matching algorithms, in addition to other applications that require better positional accuracy for moving objects in smart cities. This paper detects and validates the spatial-temporal pattern in projection vectors produced by map-matching algorithms via machine learning. Projection vectors showed a strong spatial-temporal pattern in Chicago, IL, USA, which was captured best via a local nonlinear regressor, K-nearest neighbors, and helped double the positional accuracy of unseen GPS points. While a global nonlinear regressor, multilayer Perceptron was able to slightly improve the positional accuracy of GPS points, the linear least squares had an exacerbating effect on the positional accuracy. © 2011 IEEE.",

To provide value-add services in these environments, data will have to be analysed to extract knowledge. Currently, this is typically achieved through centralised cloud-based data analytics services. However, according to many studies, this approach may present significant issues from the standpoint of data ownership, and even wireless network capacity. One possibility to cope with these shortcomings is to move data analytics closer to where data is generated. In this paper we tackle this issue by proposing and analysing a distributed learning framework, whereby data analytics are performed at the edge of the network, i.e., on locations very close to where data is generated. Specifically, in our framework, partial data analytics are performed directly on the nodes that generate the data, or on nodes close by (e.g., some of the data generators can take this role on behalf of subsets of other nodes nearby). Then, nodes exchange partial models and refine them accordingly. Our framework is general enough to host different analytics services. In the specific case analysed in the paper we focus on a learning task, considering two distributed learning algorithms. Using an activity recognition and a pattern recognition task, both on reference datasets, we compare the two learning algorithms between each other and with a central cloud solution (i.e., one that has access to the complete datasets). Our results show that using distributed machine learning techniques, it is possible to drastically reduce the network overhead, while obtaining performance comparable to the cloud solution in terms of learning accuracy. The analysis also shows when each distributed learning approach is preferable, based on the specific distribution of the data on the nodes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",
